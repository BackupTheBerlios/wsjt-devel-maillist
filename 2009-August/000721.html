Its not just me then

I would suggest however that some attention is paid to cleaning up the
code.
I see a lot of messages when compiling about skipping building sections
and a good few warnings on both gfortran and g95


for instance this lot when building with gfortran:-

But I bet the comment will be &quot; we've never seen that before&quot;

I suspect that if some time was spent cleaning up, so sections of builds
were not missed, that perhaps some of the causes would also go away.
Probably find that sooner or later it will chunder along find a bit of
a module that was skipped and fall over, seg fault

GNU Fortran (GCC) 4.3.2 &amp; G95 (GCC 4.0.4 (g95 0.91!) Jan  3 2008) used
