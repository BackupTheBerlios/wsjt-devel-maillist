<PRE>Hi Joe.

Thanks a lot for the WSPR decoder description. It should be enough for me to understand your code.

&gt;<i> I had some communication with Simon Brown many months ago, 
</I>&gt;<i> when he was working to implement JT65 in one of his 
</I>&gt;<i> programs.  I have not heard from him in a long time, and I 
</I>&gt;<i> do not know what became of his effort.
</I>
He retired recently and now he concentrates all his effort on developing a new SDR console for decoding HF digital modes in 196kHz bandwidth. He discovered the beauty of the RSID, creation of Patrick Lindecker F6CTE. RSID is a multitone diddle preceding each relation, which uniquely identifies frequency and mode to follow. The mode is identified by the sequence of tones, the frequency by the center of the RSID diddle. The tones are Reed Solomon codes, only Patrick omits those codes, that have low Hamming distance to the other codes when listening on the opposite sideband. His SDR console will watch for RSID diddles in the whole 196kHz spectrum and automatically decode all the exotic or not so exotic modes like MFSK16, Olivia, Contestia, RTTYM or DominoEX.

Simon hopes that somebody like me will port your code to C so he may easily include it into his mutimode SW.

&gt;<i> PS: Before hitting the &quot;send&quot; button, I realized that a 
</I>&gt;<i> user-configurable RxBFO setting would be very easy to do, so 
</I>&gt;<i> I went ahead and implemented it.  Please download and try 
</I>&gt;<i> the file
</I>...
&gt;<i> Please let me know if it does what you want.
</I>
Thanks, it is doing exactly what I need.

73, Vojtech AB2ZA
