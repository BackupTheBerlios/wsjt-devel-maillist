<PRE>Hi Richard,

rmbadname1: Replacing &quot;len&quot; with &quot;len_bn&quot;.
rmbadname1: Replacing &quot;len&quot; with &quot;len_bn&quot;.
rmbadname1: Replacing &quot;len&quot; with &quot;len_bn&quot;.
...
buildmodule: Could not found the body of interfaced routine  
&quot;cs_lock&quot;. Skipping.
buildmodule: Could not found the body of interfaced routine  
&quot;cs_unlock&quot;. Skipping.
buildmodule: Could not found the body of interfaced routine &quot;a2d&quot;.  
Skipping.

etc. are not gfortran errors but f2py comments because it uses  
certain keywords eg &quot;len&quot; and doesn't need these modules.   These  
warnings do not produce segmentation errors.

Found executable /usr/bin/gfortran packpfx.f90:26.37:

      if(pfx(3:3).eq.' ') pfx=' '//pfx
                                     1
Warning: CHARACTER expression will be truncated in assignment (3/4) at
      (1) packpfx.f90:27.37:

But I bet the comment will be &quot; we've never seen that before&quot;
---

Correct:   here is my version:

wsjt-v7.04-r1313]  jmn% gfortran -c -Wall packpfx.f90
wsjt-v7.04-r1313]  jmn% gfortran -c - Wall unpackpfx.f90

No errors reported.

--
I suspect that if some time was spent cleaning up, so sections of builds
were not missed, that perhaps some of the causes would also go away.
--

We have spent some time looking at all fortran and C errors produced  
during the make phase.   Warnings about the use of variables which  
may not have been initialized before use have been investigated and  
fixed.    Warnings that remain refer only to variables that have been  
defined but have not been used.     In my make phase, there are only  
5 routines which generate this warning.    At the moment, there is no  
particular need or urgency to fix these.   There are no other warning  
messages.
