<PRE>Hi Vojt&#283;ch,

Congratulations on your implementation of a standalone Tx 
capability for WSPR mode in the ATS-3b!  I have seen your 
recent posts about it, and also your web site at 
<A HREF="http://www.kufr.cz/~ok1iak/HAM/WSPR/">http://www.kufr.cz/~ok1iak/HAM/WSPR/</A> .

&gt;<i> ATS-3b and other QRP kits usually have pretty narrow IF 
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth centered around 600 or 800Hz. Your software 
</I>&gt;<i> expects the SSB IF filter be centered at 2.5kHz. Would 
</I>&gt;<i> you please extend your WSPR software to provide configurable 
</I>&gt;<i> audio frequency center?
</I>
WSPR uses a 1500 Hz audio center frequency, to be compatible 
with normal SSB transceivers.  (I assume that you know this, 
and that your mention of 2.5 kHz is just a typo.)

Yes, it would be possible to make the audio center frequency 
a user-configurable parameter.  I will put this idea on my 
list of possible new program features.

&gt;<i> I would like to add WSPR to my PocketDigi software, ... 
</I>&gt;<i> I am having difficulties to read the Fortran code. I have 
</I>&gt;<i> the encoder implemented. I know how to decode the message 
</I>&gt;<i> from soft detected four bit symbols - I will just use 
</I>&gt;<i> Phil Karn's code. It would help me a lot, if you could 
</I>&gt;<i> describe in short how your receive algorithm works - how 
</I>&gt;<i> many FFTs at which speed and spacing are you running, how 
</I>&gt;<i> do you lock onto the sync vector and whether you run any 
</I>&gt;<i> AFC and how the AFC is implemented.
</I>
When a 2-minute Rx interval is finished, WSPR starts a new 
thread to decode the received signals.  The decoding 
procedure follows a function-calling sequence that looks 
like this:

decode
   |- mept162
         |- mix162
         |- spec162
         |- sync162
         |- twkfreq
         |- decode162
               |- fano232
               |- wqdecode

Functions of the individual routines are basically as follows:

1. decode: interacts with remainder of WSPR program
2. mept162: supervises the decoding procedure
3. mix162: mixes 1500 Hz +/- 100 Hz to baseband and
    downsamples by 1/32
4. spec162: computes 2d spectrum for waterfall display
5. sync162: does FFTs using symbol-length data arrays;
    searches for WSPR sync patterns over a range of DT,
    DF, and fdot (frequency drift); returns a list of
    WSPR-signal candidates.
6. twkfreq: removes frequency offset and drift
7. decode162: computes soft symbols, removes interleaving,
    and decodes the convolutional code using the Fano
    sequential algorithm.
8. wqdecode: expands the source-encoded 50-bit message to
    give back the original user message.

WSPR samples the Rx data at 12000 Hz, and channel symbols 
are 8192 samples long.  After downsampling in mix162, the 
rate is 375 Hz and symbols are 256 samples long.  Subroutine 
sync162 calls ps162 to do the FFTs; to get a smaller 
frequency bin width I use 512-point FFTs (256 data points 
followed by 256 zeros), and transforms are computed at 
128-point (half-symbol) steps.

&gt;<i> If I do succeed, Simon Brown of the Ham Radio Deluxe &amp; DM780 
</I>&gt;<i> fame will integrate the WSPR port also.
</I>
I had some communication with Simon Brown many months ago, 
when he was working to implement JT65 in one of his 
programs.  I have not heard from him in a long time, and I 
do not know what became of his effort.



I know that we are close neighbors!  I look forward to 
meeting you some time soon.

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT

PS: Before hitting the &quot;send&quot; button, I realized that a 
user-configurable RxBFO setting would be very easy to do, so 
I went ahead and implemented it.  Please download and try 
the file
<A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR_r1314.EXE">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR_r1314.EXE</A>

You can put it in the same directory where you have already 
installed WSPR.  Set your desired Rx BFO frequency on the 
Setup --&gt; Options screen.

Please let me know if it does what you want.

There are a few other new features in this version, as well. 
  In particular, it uses hamlib commands for some CAT 
communication with popular transceivers.

	-- Joe
