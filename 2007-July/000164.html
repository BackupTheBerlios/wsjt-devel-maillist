<PRE>Dear colleagues,

I noticed that an &quot;svn commit&quot; of some tweaks to the MAP65 
code this morning was the 500th revision of our WSJT 
repository.  A milestone of sorts, I guess ...

As you have surely noticed, I have recently been busy with 
code in the map65 branch.  If you are interested in what's 
happening there, let me direct your attention to the MAP65 
Status Report at 
<A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/MAP65_Status.txt">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/MAP65_Status.txt</A> .

I have also been having a lot of fun using MAP65 on the air, 
doing EME on 2 meters.  It is very exciting to see the whole 
144 MHz digital EME band available on one's screen 
simultaneously, including the contents of messages that are 
being exchanged.  On an active weekend I commonly see 10-20 
EME signals on the waterfall at any time -- and MAP65 
decodes them all.  When a new station turns up and calls CQ, 
I see his signal immediately, and can respond after his very 
first transmission.  No advance knowledge, schedules or 
internet liaison is required.  It's a blast!

Although the MAP65 code borrows heavily from WSJT, it also 
contains a number of advances to improve the JT65 decoder 
performance.  Some of these should be back-ported to WSJT, 
in due course.

If you are interested in playing with MAP65, I put together 
a &quot;Quick Start Guide&quot; which contains a link to a compressed 
data file you can use for tests.  See
<A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/MAP65_Quick_Start.txt">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/MAP65_Quick_Start.txt</A>

Special to Hamish and Harry: it should be possible to make 
packages for MAP65 in essentially the same way you have done 
for WSJT.  If you have the time, you might consider trying 
this some time soon.  At present several beta testers are 
busy with MAP65, in addition to myself.  I will think about 
making a more general release before too long.

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
