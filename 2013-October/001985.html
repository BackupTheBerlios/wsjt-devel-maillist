<PRE>Hi All,

sorry for the long post.

For some time I have been working on an enhanced configuration dialog 
for WSJTX. This has grown
in scope to include an enhanced rig interface as well.

To test my changes I need to run with as many different rig and rig 
interface combinations as possible.
This is where you can help me out, currently I'm at the stage where I 
have the framework in place
to support direct control of rigs using the hamlib library, via DX Lab 
Suite Commander, via Ham Radio Deluxe
and, via OmniRig. None of these interfaces is perfect and they all leak 
rig implementation details to a
greater or lesser extent. Add to this the vagaries of rig manufacturers 
CAT command sets which seem
to be different on each and every rig model. This means that I cannot 
even guarantee basic functionality
until I have a test run on a rig/interface combination.

Rather than use the WSJT-X program as a test tool, I have written a 
small test application that runs the
new configuration dialog and is able to exercise the basic rig 
manipulations and queries we need. The test
application has extensive instrumentation built in so I can analyse 
results of a test and hopefully update
the code to fix defects and to accept new rig/interface combinations 
quickly.

What I am looking for is a few volunteers who are willing to try the 
test program on their station to gather
data. Currently I have a Windows build only, I am happy to make a Linux 
or Mac build if required but would
prefer to start with Windows. I intend to use Dropbox to deploy the 
software and gather the results, if you
are a Skype or ooVoo user that would help too, or phone on HF 
(propagation permitting), or VHF/UHF of you
are local to me in the UK. For complex issues I also use Mikogo desktop 
sharing but this isn't essential since
I think the instrumentation built into the test application will be 
sufficient.

I intend to extend the test to the whole user community, but for now, 
since the instrumentation generates
copious log files, I will target a few key radio models which will 
hopefully eliminate the largest number of
defects. Then I will reduce the instrumentation level and seek a wider 
user base.

Just to demonstrate the difficulties I face <A HREF="http://youtu.be/Pk7yqlTMvp8">http://youtu.be/Pk7yqlTMvp8</A> ;)

So can you help me, what rig and interface do you have, can you spare 
time to run some tests?

Currently I have coverage of Icom (IC-756), Yaesu (FT-2000) and Elecraft 
(K2 &amp; K3).
