Hey Joe,

&gt;&gt;<i> Ok, notice that I'm using Python2.4 though I think you're website cites
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that 2.5 is a requirement.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Python is a requirement, yes.  Python 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6 are all 
</I>&gt;<i> known to work fine with WSJT.  (But there are some broken Pythons 
</I>&gt;<i> around, that do not work.)
</I>
Hmm... it sounds like a broken Python release is the path I need to 
investigate.  Any ideas on what to look for would be appreciated.

As a new user here, could I give some constructive criticism to help 
future new users?   I went down the rabbit hole in trying to fulfill 
your website's posted requirements when it seems some items aren't 
really required.  Specifically, you have Python 2.5 an G95 listed which 
it seems those newer versions aren't really required.  Most older &quot;long 
term supported&quot; distros don't have some of these newer versions and it 
requires a LOT of work to update them.   Maybe if your site rephrased 
the requirements, people would save some time:

# subversion     - Only required if your want the bleeding edge releases 
(unreleased features, bug fixes, etc)

(new)Python2.3   - Python 2.3+ is known to work fine (some versions are 
spotty though).  WS1T recommends 2.5.x if possible but not a strict 
requirement

# python-dev
# python-numpy
# python-imaging-tk
# python-pmw
# libportaudio2
# libportaudio-dev
# libsamplerate0-dev

(new) fftw3-3.2.2    - It seems the 3.1.1 version fo fftw3 doesn't
(new)                  satisfy wspr's setup and will give errors like:
(new)                  cannot find -lfftw3f

(new)gfortran or g95 - gfortran included with GCC 4.2.2+ is known to 
work but K2JT recommends G95.

(new) Note on gfortran - Some versions of gfortran changed the way they
report their version and thus break things with numpy.  To resolve this:
cp /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/numpy/distutils/fcompiler/gnu.py \
/usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/numpy/distutils/fcompiler/gnu.py-orig

edit /usr/lib/python2.4/site-packages/numpy/distutils/fcompiler/gnu.py 
gnu.py and do the following (example below is for Centos 5.4)
--
           -    version_match = simple_version_match(start=r'GNU Fortran 
(?!95)')
           +    version_match = simple_version_match(start=r'GNU Fortran')

           -    version_match = simple_version_match(start='GNU Fortran 95')
           +    version_match = simple_version_match(start='GNU Fortran')
--


If I read things like that, I would have spent a lot less time on my 
compiling environment and more time on WSJT proper.



&gt;&gt;<i> $ wsjt
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Traceback (most recent call last):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     File &quot;/usr//bin/wsjt.py&quot;, line 5, in&lt;module&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       from Tkinter import *
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ImportError: No module named Tkinter
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So Python has started, but it (I guess this is your Python 2.5) does not 
</I>&gt;<i> have Tkinter installed.  This, too, is required.
</I>
Being a Python newbie, any idea on how I can get this Python 2.5.1 
release to notice all the other working python packages that I installed 
for python 2.4?


&gt;&gt;<i> Hmmmm.. that's not good.  It ultimately came down to an issue with G95.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>    It's installer seems to be broken and can't properly install itself
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> from sources.  I had to ultimately use their binaries and use them via a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> symlink.  I hate non-native binaries but it seems to work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The g95 compiler is solid and reliable in every installation I've used it.
</I>
Fair enough but g95's installer does seem to have some issues if 
compiled from scratch.  It could be due to an unlisted dependency but 
the included binaries available in the .tgz works.  Manually copying 
around the hand compiled binary vs. using &quot;make install&quot; for g95 by 
itself does NOT work.


&gt;&gt;<i> - In several respects, it seems like WSPR v2.0 has some very nice
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> features.  It has rig control (doesn't properly set USB/LSB btw),
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> support for sound cards that don't do 11025 sampling, etc.  Do you have
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any plans to update WSJT to have these features?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No.
</I>
Hmmmm... ok.  Well, if I can get more familar with Python, maybe I can 
help bring that support in if you'll take the diffs.  Having hamlib 
support in WSJT would be fantastic.  If anything else, I could 
contribute to a FAQ (if there is one) about some of the issues I hit and 
was able to resolve via web searches.



&gt;<i> The WSPR QSO mode is not popular and will probably not be retained.  For 
</I>&gt;<i> most people it's too slow, and JT65 has similar sensitivity.
</I>
Hmmmm... several HAMs here in the Bay Area that turned me on to your 
fantastic toolkit have been using WSPR QSO mode for some time now.  I 
suppose I'll concentrate on JT65 to do QSOs on HF.  Once I get the hang 
of things, I'll give EME and Meteor scatter a try.

Thanks again for your help!

--David
