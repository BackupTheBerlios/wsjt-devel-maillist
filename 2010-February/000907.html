Hey Joe,


&gt;<i> OK, this looks reasonable.  I don't know where those lines of
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;JACK tmpdir identified as [/dev/shm]&quot; come from, but then I have not 
</I>&gt;<i> played with JACK.
</I>
I think that comes from the PortAudio support.


&gt;&gt;<i> Exception in Tkinter callback
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Traceback (most recent call last):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.4/lib-tk/Tkinter.py&quot;, line 1345, in __call__
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       return self.func(*args)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.4/lib-tk/Tkinter.py&quot;, line 456, in callit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       func(*args)

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       return self._create('text', args, kw)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     File &quot;/usr/lib/python2.4/lib-tk/Tkinter.py&quot;, line 2076, in _create
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>       return getint(self.tk.call(
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> TclError: font &quot;&quot; doesn't exist
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would appear that something is broken in your Python.  For a similar 
</I>&gt;<i> problem, see email from Richard Bown, wsjt-devel 7/3/2008.  I do not 
</I>&gt;<i> recall how he fixed his problem; it was not a problem in the source code.
</I>
Ok, notice that I'm using Python2.4 though I think you're website cites 
that 2.5 is a requirement.  I DID install 2.5.1 (an out of band release 
from:

<A HREF="http://www.geekymedia.com/uncategorized/rhel5-centos5-rpms-for-python-2-5-and-2-6/">http://www.geekymedia.com/uncategorized/rhel5-centos5-rpms-for-python-2-5-and-2-6/</A>

Centos requires 2.4 to properly function, I didn't replace the default 
python binary.  Just tried that via a symlink (ln -s /usr/bin/python2.5 
/usr/bin/python) and now I see:
--
$ wsjt
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File &quot;/usr//bin/wsjt.py&quot;, line 5, in &lt;module&gt;
     from Tkinter import *
ImportError: No module named Tkinter
--

It's interesting to me that Python2.4 would find all of the other 
libraries, etc. but this new 2.5.1 version won't.  Any ideas?   I'm not 
that familiar with Python.  Maybe I can update Pthyon's library path?
Tk and it's related dependencies are install but via RPMs:
--
tk-8.4.13-5.el5_1.1
python-imaging-tk-1.1.6-4.el5.kb
tkinter-2.4.3-27.el5
tk-devel-8.4.13-5.el5_1.1
--

If I can't use the Python2.4 libraries, maybe I can install these 
modules in a similar fashion to say how Perl does it with CPAN?


&gt;<i> As far as I know, none of us in the &quot;devel&quot; group has used the Centos 
</I>&gt;<i> distribution, so you're likely to be on your own for finding this bug.
</I>
Yeah.. that's not surprising.  A stock Centos distribution is not  HAM 
friendly.  It's taken me some serious amount of time to get all of the 
dependencies built up but it's working reliably now for the most part. 
I must admit, your toolset has has been the most challenging of all the 
programs I've compiled for the HAM side of things.


&gt;<i> The program restarts in the mode you were in when you terminated it. 
</I>&gt;<i> You are therefore starting in JT65 mode, and you will see the same error 
</I>&gt;<i> as before.
</I>
Actually, that's not true for my setup.  I will re-select FSK144 and 
then exit.  Upon restarting, I'll be back in say JT65.


&gt;&gt;<i> Ps. I had unicasted an email to you about compiling issues with WSJT a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> week or so ago.  I'm beyond that point now but I'm curious if you
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> received it?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> No.
</I>
Hmmmm.. that's not good.  It ultimately came down to an issue with G95. 
  It's installer seems to be broken and can't properly install itself 
from sources.  I had to ultimately use their binaries and use them via a 
symlink.  I hate non-native binaries but it seems to work.


Few related questions if I may:

- Curious, is there any plan to make your tools compatible with gfortran 
(GCC 4.1.2)?  The configure script gives it as an option but your 
website says one must use G95.

- In several respects, it seems like WSPR v2.0 has some very nice 
features.  It has rig control (doesn't properly set USB/LSB btw), 
support for sound cards that don't do 11025 sampling, etc.  Do you have 
any plans to update WSJT to have these features?

- I really do like WSPR but as I understand it, your WSPR app is only 
for the beaconing effort.  To get 2way WSPR, you can only do that in 
WSJT today.  Any plans to add 2way WSPR to the &quot;wspr&quot; program?
