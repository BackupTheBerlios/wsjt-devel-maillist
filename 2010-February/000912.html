Hello Joe,

Well, following on another WSJT / Linux user's recommendation, I tried 
version 5.9.8r558 and that version compiled and works!  I was able to 
copy a QSO between a HAM in South Africa and two HAMs in Texas.  I tried 
replying to the S.Africa user's CQ but either he couldn't hear me or he 
couldn't decode me.

Anyway, I received a few ideas about trying to resolve my Python2.5 
library issues (the recommendation was to build those libraries from 
scratch while explictly calling the python2.5 binary and that should put 
the resulting libs in a place that 2.5 can find them.  We'll see how 
that goes.

Curious, are there significant benefits of say 7.04/7.05 over version 
5.9.8?  I would assume so.

&gt;<i> Hi David,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As a new user here, could I give some constructive criticism to help
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> future new users?   I went down the rabbit hole in trying to fulfill
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> your website's posted requirements when it seems some items aren't
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> really required.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> If I read things like that, I would have spent a lot less time on my
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> compiling environment and more time on WSJT proper.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sorry to say, as far as I know we don't have anyone who can spend the 
</I>&gt;<i> time required to help others compile WSJT, WSPR, MAP65, or MAP65-IQ on 
</I>&gt;<i> an arbitrary OS or distribution.  We have put a lot of effort into 
</I>&gt;<i> using platform-independent tools and making sure that the programs can 
</I>&gt;<i> be built with free and/or open-source tools.  We make click-to-install 
</I>&gt;<i> packages for Windows and a number of *nix distributions, and we have 
</I>&gt;<i> put together lists of pre-requisite packages for the most widely used 
</I>&gt;<i> Linux distributions.  We know that WSJT, WSPR, etc., can be built on 
</I>&gt;<i> nearly *any* up-to-date unix-like OS.  Some users who have put in the 
</I>&gt;<i> necessary work have written &quot;HowTo&quot; files that go into the repository 
</I>&gt;<i> for the benefit of others.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> While blazing a new trail, you may be on your own for a while.
</I>
