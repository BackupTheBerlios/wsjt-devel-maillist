<PRE>Hi David,

&gt;<i> As a new user here, could I give some constructive criticism to help
</I>&gt;<i> future new users?   I went down the rabbit hole in trying to fulfill
</I>&gt;<i> your website's posted requirements when it seems some items aren't
</I>&gt;<i> really required.
</I>&gt;<i> [...]
</I>&gt;<i> If I read things like that, I would have spent a lot less time on my
</I>&gt;<i> compiling environment and more time on WSJT proper.
</I>
Sorry to say, as far as I know we don't have anyone who can spend the 
time required to help others compile WSJT, WSPR, MAP65, or MAP65-IQ on 
an arbitrary OS or distribution.  We have put a lot of effort into using 
platform-independent tools and making sure that the programs can be 
built with free and/or open-source tools.  We make click-to-install 
packages for Windows and a number of *nix distributions, and we have put 
together lists of pre-requisite packages for the most widely used Linux 
distributions.  We know that WSJT, WSPR, etc., can be built on nearly 
*any* up-to-date unix-like OS.  Some users who have put in the necessary 
work have written &quot;HowTo&quot; files that go into the repository for the 
benefit of others.

While blazing a new trail, you may be on your own for a while.

	-- Joe, K1JT
