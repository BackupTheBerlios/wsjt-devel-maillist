Python is a requirement, yes.  Python 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6 are all 
known to work fine with WSJT.  (But there are some broken Pythons 
around, that do not work.)

&gt;<i> $ wsjt
</I>&gt;<i> Traceback (most recent call last):
</I>&gt;<i>     File &quot;/usr//bin/wsjt.py&quot;, line 5, in&lt;module&gt;
</I>&gt;<i>       from Tkinter import *
</I>&gt;<i> ImportError: No module named Tkinter
</I>
So Python has started, but it (I guess this is your Python 2.5) does not 
have Tkinter installed.  This, too, is required.


&gt;<i> Hmmmm.. that's not good.  It ultimately came down to an issue with G95.
</I>&gt;<i>    It's installer seems to be broken and can't properly install itself
</I>&gt;<i> from sources.  I had to ultimately use their binaries and use them via a
</I>&gt;<i> symlink.  I hate non-native binaries but it seems to work.
</I>
The g95 compiler is solid and reliable in every installation I've used it.

&gt;<i> - Curious, is there any plan to make your tools compatible with gfortran
</I>&gt;<i> (GCC 4.1.2)?  The configure script gives it as an option but your
</I>&gt;<i> website says one must use G95.
</I>
Compiling with gfortran works fine too.  I use it all the time.

&gt;<i> - In several respects, it seems like WSPR v2.0 has some very nice
</I>&gt;<i> features.  It has rig control (doesn't properly set USB/LSB btw),
</I>&gt;<i> support for sound cards that don't do 11025 sampling, etc.  Do you have
</I>&gt;<i> any plans to update WSJT to have these features?
</I>
No.

&gt;<i> - I really do like WSPR but as I understand it, your WSPR app is only
</I>&gt;<i> for the beaconing effort.  To get 2way WSPR, you can only do that in
</I>&gt;<i> WSJT today.  Any plans to add 2way WSPR to the &quot;wspr&quot; program?
</I>
The WSPR QSO mode is not popular and will probably not be retained.  For 
most people it's too slow, and JT65 has similar sensitivity.
