Hello Everyone,

I'm posting here hoping I can get a hand with WSJT v7.03 or 7.05(trunk). 
  I know the WSPR forums are more active than this WSJT list but I need 
to try here first.

After some major wrangling, I've been able to compile both WSPR 
2.00r1714 and WSJT (both 7.03r1090 and 7.05r1800 [trunk]) on Centos 5.4.


as an FYI, WSPR works well with my setup JACK/ALSA and Hamlib on Centos 
5.4 and I've confirmed I've been heard via WSPRNet.

    (I have this all documented if you'd like to see it.  This doc 
covers packet radio, fldigi, Xastir, etc. too)


WSJT is another matter.  If I start the program up, it comes up with 
it's various defaults.  When I re-configure it to use a resampled ALSA 
source 
(<A HREF="http://list-serv.davidv.net/pipermail/moon-net_list-serv.davidv.net/2008-August/013751.html">http://list-serv.davidv.net/pipermail/moon-net_list-serv.davidv.net/2008-August/013751.html</A>) 
and restart WSJT, it loads up fine.  The clock in the lower left updates 
every second, the soundcard in vs out slew constantly updates, etc. If I 
click on monitor, the lower right corner says &quot;receiving&quot;, things decode 
in the main window, and SPECJT shows the waterfall, I can transmit too!

I just tried and with 7.05r1800 trunk, I can also select JT6M and it 
seems to work.  In either 7.03 or 7.05, if I change to say mode JT65 
(what my goal is or any of the other offered modes), the lower left 
clock stops updating, the soundcard in vs out slew is no longer 
updating, and the bottom now only has &quot;message #2&quot;, &quot;message #4&quot;, and 
&quot;message #5&quot;, and the green &quot;receiving&quot; in the lower left is gone:

 
<A HREF="http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/HAM/WSJT-and-WSPR/wsjt-main-jt65a.png">http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~dranch/HAM/WSJT-and-WSPR/wsjt-main-jt65a.png</A>

What's interesting to me is that the SPECJT waterfall continues to 
update though once it hits the very right of the window, it seems to 
overwrite itself for a period of time before it starts over again 
(notice how tall the scope line is.. it's even writing into the 
waterfall section).  .  This overwrite behavior doesn't happen with 
FSK411 as once it hits the very right of the window, the main WSJT 
window does a decode and updates it's graphics.

Once I shutdown WSJT and restart it, it then always defaults to whatever 
non-FSK144 mode and thus the program no longer works.  It's only once I 
edit the ~.wsjt/WSJT.INI file and change the mode line back to FSK144 
(or JT6M for 7.05), will the program start working again.

I also tried out WSJT8 and WSJT8a from SVN and those versions seem to be 
in various states of disrepair. WSJS8 won't finish compiling and WSJT8a 
has most of the modes ripped out (I want WSPR and JT65).

Any thoughts?
