<PRE>I just checked in my snapshot of the wpsr branch; still not fully 
debugged, but I wanted to get the progress checked in if I'm not able to 
do more.  I did verify that it still works for decode on little-endian 
linux, so I shouldn't have broken much, if anything. 

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. WSPR uses 12000 Hz sampling.  WSJT, alas, uses 11025 Hz.  It would 
</I>&gt;<i> be better use 12000 Hz everywhere now, ... but that means a lot of 
</I>&gt;<i> changes in WSJT.  I haven't yet felt the time was right for making 
</I>&gt;<i> this major change.
</I>
Understand.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. For its beacon-like purposes, WSPR wants to decode all the signals 
</I>&gt;<i> it finds in a narrow band segment, currently 200 Hz.  For making QSOs, 
</I>&gt;<i> WSJT may want to focus on signals within &quot;Tol&quot; of the &quot;Freeze DF&quot;.
</I>This would actually be really nice for standalone as well, as I have 
wished I could move the passband, either to expand to catch people  out 
of band (or the multi-mode visual/wspr mept), or to run other programs 
to monitor other parts of the audio passband.  A tunable center and 
width would be great....I meant to look at it sometime.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Tx works perfectly fine, but Rx is not decoding correctly....sync, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> snr, and freq identification are all good, but somewhere from 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decode162 on isn't working, as everything comes out undecodable ('*** 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> ??? ***').  Fano seems to see the signals OK (low cycle count when 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> processing), but but that's as far as I got. My WSPRing on 30m right 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> now is from the Mac, and it's being copied well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Hmmm...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Present versions of wqencode.f90 and wqdecode.f90 should be copied 
</I>&gt;<i> from trunk into the wspr branch, but I don't think that's your 
</I>&gt;<i> problem.  If the Fano cycle count is low it has almost certainly 
</I>&gt;<i> decoded the 50-bit binary message correctly.  It sounds like something 
</I>&gt;<i> is amiss when unpacking those 50 bits to produce human-readable messages?
</I>Yeah, they are clearly wrong, probably coming out of fano.  I'll look at 
it tonight if I get a chance.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> WSJT:  I've only tried JT65A.  JT65A receives and decodes fine, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seems to Tx OK.  However, I'm getting bogus DFs in some places, and 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> certainly when I click in the spectrum to try to decode something, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the resulting df is bogus.  I haven't looked at that at all, but 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> probably simple.  John, do you see that as well?
</I>
I should have said &quot;when I click on the waterfall&quot;, not spectrum.  This 
is probably another endian/architecure thing, as it seems to be fine on 
linux/little-endian.  I still haven't looked into it.
