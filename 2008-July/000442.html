<PRE>I've been running WSPR r944 for about 10 hours on osx; so far, so good.  
I might not have time (*maybe* tonight) to do any code work before I 
leave town , so here are a few thoughts:

1) &quot;Badmsg: ...&quot; appears in the WSPR bandmap when such messages are 
received...probably shouldn't.

2) I changed WSPR long ago to have pttport be a char*80, but WSJT still 
has it as char*12...that just doesn't work for some of the dynamic 
device names which are generated on linux/osx; e.g., even /dev/ttyUSB0 
is 12 chars, and thus doesn't have a termination (e.g., my interface on 
osx shows up as &quot;/dev/tty.WMRRIGblasterPP&quot;).

3) What is the plan for WSPR reception of QSO messages?  If it decodes 
them, then we need to figure out what to do about uploading them.    
What records received, besides beaconing, do we want to upload? Code to 
handle that will need to be both in wspr.py and the web site.   The 
current wspr.py assumes a fixed structure of whitespace-delimited fields 
from decoded.txt (e.g., drift comes right after call, grid, dbm), so 
that might need to be changed.  I could see uploading just beacons, 
beacons + CQs, or everything.

It will be interesting to see how this develops...will WSPR QSOs 
congregate around traditional WSJT frequencies, or will they co-exist in 
the traditional WSPR locations?  I guess it's pretty much the same on 
30m.  Also, there's really no reason that I see to &quot;match&quot; DF on WSPR, 
as long as people are using a common passband, and everything in that 
passband is decoded.
