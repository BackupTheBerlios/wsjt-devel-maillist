<PRE>Here's an update on recent activity recently with the WSJT 
and WSPR code base.  You may have noticed that a lot has 
been happening ...

Major goals of this activity include the following:

1. Implement encoding and decoding of structured QSO-style 
messages for WSPR mode.

2. Add support for WSPR mode to WSJT.

3. Test a possible new EME-optimized mode, tentatively 
called JT64.

4. Clean up the code so that standard compilers produce few 
warning messages, even with their &quot;fussiest&quot; warning modes 
enabled.  This helps to make the code portable.

5. Make the code &quot;endian independent&quot; so that it can run on 
big-endian CPUs, including older (non-Intel) Macintoshes.

6. Improve the &quot;configure&quot; script's ability to determine 
everything necessary to permit successful building of the 
executable programs on many platforms.


A limited (beta) release of WSJT to enable more widespread 
on-the-air testing of WSPR-mode QSOs will be desirable soon.

At the same time, a new release of WSPR should be made, 
updated so that it can decode the new WSPR-QSO-mode messages.

A request:

How about some volunteers for making installable .rpm, .deb, 
etc., packages for released versions of WSJT, WSPR, maybe 
even MAP65?  We have quite a few requests from people who 
would like to use these programs under one or another flavor 
of *nix, but are not comfortable building the programs on 
their own.

Some major programming tasks still to be undertaken:

1. Begin to convert all WSJT modes to use a 12000 Hz 
sampling rate, rather than 11025 Hz.  This is important 
because so many Windows sound systems do a very poor job of 
resampling from 48000 Hz (which usually is the hardware 
sample rate) to 11025 Hz.

2. Further cleanups of the code.  For example, we currently 
use several different FFT routines in WSJT.  For performance 
reasons, it may be desirable to replace them with calls to 
the FFTW package.

No doubt I have forgotten some things that should have been 
in the above lists.  Comments and advice about any of these 
matters will be appreciated!
