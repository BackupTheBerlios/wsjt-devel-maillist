<PRE>Joe,

I did reproduce the error.It appears sporadicly. Here are condition of
use of WSJT standalone:

WSPR was fired up on the air. Dial freq 144.3110, TX frq
1443110.001500 .TX freq is waht I have after double clicking in the
middle on the display (500).  33% T/R cycle. Audio level from the radio
was as high as to produce 0db input level for WSJT. WSJT was compiled
using g95 as while compiled with gfortran it goes fine but WSPR program
crashes during the start with segmentation error message.

It crashes three times for several hours. Much stable than before
although I use the same r944. So I have some thing in mind. The first
time it crashes without any error message. Second time the error was:

At line 56 of file mept162.F
Traceback: (Innermost first)
   Called from line 132 of file decode162.f
   Called from line 62 of file mept162.F
   Called from line 16 of file decode.F90
   Called from line 85 of file wspr2.F90
   Called from line -1265364616 of file &#65533;&#65533;&#65533;I
   Called from line 0 of file Segmentation fault

The last time I got this error message:

At line 128 of file decode162.f
Traceback: (Innermost first)
   Called from line 132 of file decode162.f
   Called from line 62 of file mept162.F
   Called from line 16 of file decode.F90
   Called from line 85 of file wspr2.F90
   Called from line 0 of file Segmentation fault

All test done on IBM Thinkpad PIII 500Mhz 256Mb notebook. I noticed some
time during decode computer became too slugish. Is it possible due to
slow speed or low RAM to have time out or so and then crash? I did
record the last WAVs before any crash. When I start again WSPR I open
the last recorded WAV to be decoded but WSPR does not crash at all.

I hope this helps.

73, Harry LZ1BB
