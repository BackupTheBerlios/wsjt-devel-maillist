Harry,

What mode and other settings were you using when you saw this?

I had WSJT running in JT65A mode for 12 hours last night with deep 
search and include average in deep search selected and didn't see one 
error in the console.

I can test further later on tonight if I know the exact settings you had 
selected when you saw this error occur.

If this is also available in a wave file you might have saved somewhere, 
I'd be glad to run it locally on my machine and see if I can reproduce 
the error that way.

Rick Kunath, k9ao
