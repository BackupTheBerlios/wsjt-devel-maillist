<PRE>In the &quot;Other News&quot; category:

In addition to what's been happening with WSPR, a lot of good work has 
been done recently with WSJT and MAP65, as well.

WSJT is ready for some user input on the WSPR QSO mode.  In the next few 
days I plan to make a Windows package for release as a &quot;beta&quot;, asking 
interested users to report their on-the-air experiences with it, and 
soliciting suggestions for improvement.  I hope that this process can 
lead to a full release of WSJT 7.0 fairly soon afterward.

Today I found and fixed a bug in MAP65 that has been annoying me for 
months.  I also upgraded the program in several ways, finally making 
some progress on a &quot;MAP65 To Do&quot; list I've had around since late last 
year.  This work should lead to a new MAP65 release within the next 
month or so.  If you are interested and able to use and test MAP65 on 
the air, please let me know.

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
