<PRE>Hi John,

&gt;&gt;<i> Yes, there are some pains related to the structure
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> of our code tree.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Would it be possible to have a common code tree and and a clever 
</I>&gt;<i> configure such that one could:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>       configure --with-code=xxx
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> where xxx would be WSPR or WSJT6 or whatever, and an appropriate 
</I>&gt;<i> Makefile would be generated to select only those modules from the code 
</I>&gt;<i> tree that are required for a specific final executable?
</I>
Diane is probably the one to answer this.  I would imagine it's 
possible, but I'm not sure that it's the best solution.

What might be even more helpful would be to gather the mature code -- 
especially routines used in more than one of our three branches -- and 
organize it into one or more linkable libraries.

&gt;<i> Bruce writes about decode162 in WSPR:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; somewhere from decode162 on isn't working, as
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; everything comes out undecodable ('*** ??? ***')
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> WSPR from r867 works and decodes everything.   I'll try r914 (or 
</I>&gt;<i> whatever Bruce recommends) and see what happens.
</I>
I concur that r867 is OK.  I have a post-r867 version that is also OK, 
and is close to what I think we should release soon.  It does not yet 
have the big-endian fixes, because Bruce was doing that; I haven't 
committed it because I'm waiting for Bruce to confirm that this would 
not cause him trouble.

&gt;<i> Bruce writes about JT65A
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; when I click in the spectrum to try to decode something,
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; the resulting df is bogus.  I haven't looked at that at all,
</I>&gt;<i>  &gt; but probably simple.  John, do you see that as well?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I need to go and test this in JT65A - I only have Joe's example files to 
</I>&gt;<i> work with at the moment.
</I>
I will check this, too.

	-- Joe
