<PRE>Thanks, John, both for the change you submitted and the description of 
the specjt df selection problem.  This is in fact the problem I had 
reported a week or so ago when I first started getting WSJT running on 
the Mac G5; I had suspected it was an endian bug, but I didn't have time 
to look at it before going on holiday.  Last night, I dug into this a 
bit as well, and I certainly have the same problem.

At first I thought it was exactly as you describe, however, I believe 
it's not that the coordinates are relative to the WSJT window; it seems 
they are relative to where the SPECJT window was initially placed (e.g., 
moving the WSJT window doesn't change the relative offset in SPECJT, 
just moving SPECJT).  Let me know if that's not clear.

</I>&gt;<i> delivered (in event.x and event.y).  The coordinates are given  
</I>&gt;<i> relative to the WSJT window.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If specjt.py is launched on its own (of course, it won't work, but  
</I>&gt;<i> the test is needed) then root.geometry returns the correct

</I>&gt;<i> window is moved on the screen.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have not managed to crack this problem.  It evidently does not

</I>&gt;<i> window.   If you particularly want it in some special place, edit  
</I>&gt;<i> WSJT.INI and change:    SpecJTGeometry +80+40     where  the numerals  
</I>&gt;<i> refer to +x+y coordinates of the window.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If any one knows how to solve this problem (I have tried a variety of  
</I>&gt;<i> different calls, but none works) please let me know.
