<PRE>Bruce --

Good to hear from you!  You must have been reading my mind, as your 
suggested actions coincide very well with what I've been planning.  So 
much the better if you will do it.

The nascent GUI features for QSO mode in the WSPR program should 
definitely be removed.  They were there only for the purpose of some 
brief on-the-air tests.  WSPR (the program) is to remain a tool for 
bi-directional beacon-like activity, not for QSOs; WSPR-mode QSOs will 
be made with WSJT.

My own view is that the width measurement is not very useful, and should 
probably be eliminated.  Drift is more useful: among other things, it 
provides useful feedback to people with unstable rigs.  I think it 
should be kept.  Its usefulness in your database is perhaps more open to 
question; I could probably be convinced of either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.  If you 
need to recover space in the on-line database display, you could 
probably eliminate power in Watts and/or miles ... or make them optional.
