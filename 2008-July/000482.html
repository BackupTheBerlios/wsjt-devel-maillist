<PRE>Dear Colleagues,

Many thanks for all of your input in the last 24 hours!

I have packaged the Windows version of WSPR 1.0, r972 and 
placed it on the WSJT Home Page at

   <A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR100.EXE">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR100.EXE</A>

I packaged the Windows version of WSJT 7, r967 and placed it at

   <A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT700r967.EXE">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT700r967.EXE</A>

Later today I will post announcements to the &quot;wsjtgroup&quot; and 
&quot;Knightsqrss&quot; lists.  A draft copy of the announcement is 
appended below; if you have suggestions for improvements, 
please let me know!

	-- Joe, K1JT

###############################################################

Dear Friends of WSJT and WSPR,

On behalf of the WSJT/WSPR development group, I write to let 
you know that program versions implementing the WSPR QSO 
mode are now available.

1. If you are a WSPR user, you should upgrade to the new 
version 1.0 as soon as possible.  Its operational features 
are changed very little, but the new version supports 
reception of the new QSO-mode messages.  Continued use of 
the older WSPR 0.7 will lead to confusion (and the display 
of spurious-looking messages) whenever the program attempts 
to decode the new message types.  You can download WSPR 1.0 
(r972) from

   <A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR100.EXE">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR100.EXE</A>

2. To make WSPR-mode QSOs you must install WSJT Version 7, 
which is now being made available as a beta release.  You 
can download it from

   <A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT700r967.EXE">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT700r967.EXE</A>

This is a beta release, since the WSPR QSO mode needs some 
thorough on-the-air testing.  You may wish to keep your 
present WSJT 6 available, as well; in that case we suggest 
installing to a new directory such as

	C:\Program Files\WSJT7

You can copy your existing file WSJT.INI into the new 
installation directory, to preserve your settings.  Add your 
first name to the new field &quot;MyName&quot; on the new
Setup -&gt; Options  screen.

A User's Guide for WSJT 7 has yet to be written.  However, a 
Quick-Start guide for the WSPR QSO mode is available at

   <A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR_mode.pdf">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR_mode.pdf</A>

A copy of this document should be found in your installation 
directory after you install WSJT 7.  Be sure to read it 
before attempting to make WSPR-mode QSOs!


WSJT and WSPR can be compiled and used under Linux, FreeBSD, 
Mac OS X, and other flavors of Unix as well as Windows. 
Installable binary packages for particular platforms will be 
made available if/when we have volunteers who can make the 
packages for particular platforms and distributions.  In the 
meantime, to run on *nix you will need to build the programs 
from source code available from the repository at

   <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/wsjt/">http://developer.berlios.de/projects/wsjt/</A>

Please send your comments, suggestions, and bug reports on 
these new releases to k1jt at arrl dot net.

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
