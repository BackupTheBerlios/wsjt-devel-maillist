<PRE>Hi all,

Releasing WSPR 1.0 and the WSJT 7 beta has already brought 
in some very useful information.

Some program weaknesses just don't come to light until there 
is thorough on-the-air testing by users.  I made many 
WSPR-mode QSOs last evening, using both 10.139 and 14.076 
MHz dial frequency, and I monitored many other QSOs.  I was 
running both WSPR and WSJT most of the time.

Some observations:

1. WSPR needs some work on the way QSO-mode messages are 
handled in the on-screen displays, and maybe also in the 
uploading procedure.  Those things work fine for beacon-mode 
messages, but not for all QSO-mode messages.  I had not 
taken note of some changes made by Bruce to the Python code, 
in which a decoded message is parsed into three fields 
(call, grid, power) before being displayed on screen.   This 
is fine for the beacon messages, but QSO-mode messages have 
a much wider range of formats.  I will back out those 
changes and go back to a column-oriented parsing of decoded 
text, retaining the &quot;field&quot; information for uploaded 
messages only.

2. The decoder in WSPR performs better, on average, than the 
one in WSJT.  I'm not yet sure of the cause, but I suspect 
that it may have to do with the different sampling rate 
(12000 in WSPR, and 11025 Hz in WSJT -- the latter is poorly 
executed in many windows sound systems).  We will surely 
want to address this problem, and correct it.

3. Then there is &quot;Harry's problem&quot;.  On his machines, 
compiling with gfortran produces executable code that 
segfaults.  (Always?  Sometimes? )  Compiling with g95 
produces executable code that runs for a while and then 
sporadicly produces a crash, sometimes with error messages 
and sometimes without.

The problem does not exist in Windows executables, whether 
compiled by CVF or by MinGW.  I do not think it exists in OS 
X, or in BSD.  It does not exist on my Debian Sarge 
distribution, where both gfortran and g95 executables work OK.

But it does exist when the program is compiled and run with 
the tools in certain late Linux distributions.  We know 
there is a bug in numpy 1.1.0; but apparently there is 
something else, as well.  We need to find a reproducible way 
to generate the failure, and then identify the problem.

I'm sure we will be getting more useful feedback over the 
next week or so...

	-- Joe
