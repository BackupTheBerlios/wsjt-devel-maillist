<PRE>Hi Richard,

 From the information you've provided, it's impossible to 
tell where your attempt to compile WSJT r386 on Ubuntu 8.04 
went astray.  As I think you know, a number of Python 
packages and other pre-requisites need to be installed 
before you can compile Audio.so.

The file wsjtrc is part of the distribution; it is not 
&quot;created&quot; when you run WSJT.

It would be nice to have a few knowledgeable volunteers who 
can create complete installable packages for released 
versions of WSJT (and also WSPR and MAP65), targeted at the 
most popular distributions/platforms of Linux, FreeBSD, and 
Macintosh.  Right now we don't always have that luxury, and 
the core development team is busy with other enhancement and 
maintenance issues that we consider important.  If you want 
to roll your own, on a *nix distribution that none of us 
regularly uses, you're on your own ... or should ask for 
help from others who have already succeeded.  To my 
knowledge, there is no modern *nix distribution on which 
WSJT cannot be made to run.

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
