<PRE>Please welcome the latest new member of our development 
group: 	Kari Sillanmaki, OH2GQC!

Kari, if you are not already subscribed to the wsjt-devel 
and wsjt-svn mailing lists, you will want to do so.  Go to

   <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/wsjt/">http://developer.berlios.de/projects/wsjt/</A>

and click on &quot;Lists&quot; under the banner

   Project: WSJT - Summary

near the top.

Now is probably a good time to remind everyone of our 
operating procedures.  Ours is a very loosely organized 
group.  We have three publicly released programs: WSJT, 
WSPR, and MAP65.  WSJT probably has a few thousand users, 
while WSPR has around 300-500 and MAP65 perhaps 20 or so. 
Most people run the programs on Windows, but an increasing 
number use various flavors of *nix.  Nearly all of us in the 
development group do much of our work -- for some, I think 
all of our work -- under Linux or FreeBSD.  All three the 
programs can be compiled and run on any of these platforms, 
and we try to keep it that way.

Everyone has write access to the repository.  You should 
feel free to commit source code changes that you are happy 
with.  If you notice that someone else is working on code in 
a similar part of the code tree, or wonder if your change 
might conflict with what someone else has intended, it may 
be best to ask before committing.

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
