I am definatrely against it! It is very easy to say that the problems
Harry accounted concerned his own computer. I must say that it is not my
computer's problem! The only reason I have problems is that I use modern
Linux distribution. If you apdate your ancient Linux boxes you woill see
my problems. What I mean?! Here on last Mandriva, Debian Testing, Ubuntu
and Fedora I have the same problem. On different computers!!! WSJT
compiles with gfortran but on each atempt to start it crashes with
&quot;Segmentation faults&quot;. Using g95 always finish with compile error. At
the same time while I do use old distributions of different type I do
not see any problem!

Please answer me. How my computer was fine for two years to compile WSJT
and I was capable to make the process for two years and now my computer
is bad and doing local computer issue and I became an incompetent WSJT
compiler after I was competent for all those two years?

I do repeat I do use several computers and several distributions. The
only difference between you and me is that I use the last Linux
distributions and you use so ancient Linux distributions so you could
not see the problems. Unfortunately I am not a developer. So I could
nopt help inlthis issue. I am just an experienced WSJT operator and
experienced beta tester. At the present time I use my vote as a team
member. So I vote against WSJT release. Please test my statement or
throw me out of the team! WSJT is not ready for a release concerning
modern GNU/Linux. Joe said once that Linux user's society is so small
compared to Windows users so it is not important. Well I believe you, as
I did not tested alone here is Linux only house, that WSJT works fine
under Windows. Please do believe me WSJT is not ready for Linux release
yet!

Thank you for the attention.

73, Harry Popov LZ1BB
