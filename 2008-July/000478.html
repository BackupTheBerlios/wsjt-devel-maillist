<PRE>Rick,

My answer seems to be not compleat. I know fftw is compiled in some
different way than before in Mandriva 2008.1. Richard reported. Perhaps
you had to recompile. Here I use standard fftw deb of Debian repositary.
I think we should always use standard distribution packages when we try
to produce code which must work on all users computers. Well compiled
the last revision of WSPR today and it stayed solid for almost an hour.
(which is personal record here :)) Then I had again the error:

 At line 56 of file mept162.F
Traceback: (Innermost first)
   Called from line 132 of file decode162.f
   Called from line 63 of file mept162.F
   Called from line 16 of file decode.F90
   Called from line 86 of file wspr2.F90
   Called from line -7622505 of file Segmentation fault

Can you tell me how long WSPR is running on your computer without crash
in hours?

I am almost sure I do suffer from using newer version of a given library
or program than it was used in development process. As it was with
python-numpy 1.1.0. I had to downgrade to 1.04.0 to solve the problem
thanks to Diane's advice. But why and who will downgrade their fresh
installed Linux distributions just to use the code of WSJT. At my
computer Disk space is always very valuable and I really hate to install
Mbs of libraries which serve to only one program.
