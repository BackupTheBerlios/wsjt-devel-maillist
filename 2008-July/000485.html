<PRE>Dear Friends of WSJT and WSPR,

On behalf of the WSJT/WSPR development group, I write to let you know 
that new program versions implementing the WSPR QSO mode are now available.

1. If you are a WSPR user, you should upgrade to version 1.0 as soon as 
possible.  Its operational features are changed very little, but the new 
version supports reception and decoding of the new QSO-mode messages. 
Continued use of the older WSPR 0.7 may lead to confusion (and the 
display of spurious-looking messages) whenever the program attempts to 
decode the new message types.  You can download WSPR 1.0 (r972) from

    <A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR100.EXE">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR100.EXE</A>

2. To make WSPR-mode QSOs you must install WSJT Version 7, which is now 
being made available as a beta release.  You can download it from

    <A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT700r973.EXE">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT700r973.EXE</A>

This is a beta release because the WSPR QSO mode needs some thorough 
on-the-air testing.  You may wish to keep your present WSJT 6 available, 
as well; in that case we suggest installing to a new directory such as

	C:\Program Files\WSJT7

You can copy your existing file WSJT.INI into the new installation 
directory, to preserve your settings.  Add your operator name to the new 
field &quot;MyName&quot; on the new Setup -&gt; Options  screen.


A User's Guide for WSJT 7 has yet to be written.  However, basic WSPR 
instructions are available at

   <A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR_Quick_Start.TXT">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR_Quick_Start.TXT</A>

and a Quick-Start guide for the WSPR QSO mode at

    <A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR_mode.pdf">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR_mode.pdf</A>

A copy of this document should also be found in your installation 
directory after you install WSJT 7.  Be sure to read it before 
attempting to make WSPR-mode QSOs!

We recommend that WSPR-mode QSOs should be made in the same frequency 
ranges where JT65 activity takes place.  Beacon-like WSPR activity (as 
opposed to 2-way QSOs) should remain in the distinct 200 Hz sub-bands 
where it nor resides.


WSJT and WSPR can be compiled and used under Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, 
and other flavors of Unix as well as Windows. Installable binary 
packages for particular platforms will be made available if/when we have 
volunteers who can make the packages needed for particular platforms and 
distributions.  In the meantime, to run on *nix you will need to build 
the programs from source code, which is always available at

    <A HREF="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/wsjt/">http://developer.berlios.de/projects/wsjt/</A>

Links to *.tgz snapshots of source code for WSPR 1.0 (r967) and WSJT 7 
(r973) will be placed on the WSJT Home page within a day or two.

Please send your comments, suggestions, and bug reports on these new 
releases to k1jt at arrl dot net.

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
