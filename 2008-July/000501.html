Not quite as I do not use Ubuntu but Debian Testing. I know you read
wsjtgroup listserver. You should mentioned that Chuck AF4O had the same
prblem with Ubuntu and after my instructions he installed g95 and after
he recompiled wsjt the problem disapeared. I mean he has working WSJT
now. Thhis was very good news for me as before it I felt as handicapted
unexperiencedn wsjt compiler and I felt really gilty infront of the
development team as I had the wrong computer with local hardware problem
and that was a local problem with compilling wsjt.

Please next time do believe me. I do spend a lot of time and effort for
beta testing before I send my bug reports!

I am pritty sure the problem is comming from this that we do use modern
updated distributions with newer versions of libraries. While you stiull
do use ancients GMU/Linux distributions and this is your problem to
catch our problems. The GNU/Linux world is very dinamical. If you do not
update your GNU/Linux installed distributions you will never understand
our problems.
