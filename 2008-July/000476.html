Harry,

I ran WSPR (the stand alone not the WSPR mode in WSJT) for a long time last 
night here on Mandriva 2008.1 and didn't have any crashes. I did run the WSPR 
mode in WSJT for a while too, no issues, but I didn't have it going for long. 
And WSJT ran fine for long periods too.

Any way I can try more to duplicate your errors there?

How are your fftw libs compiled, do they have the --enable-type-prefix option 
enabled and did you build the double and single (float) precision libs. I did 
here, just trying to see what any differences might be.

Let me know and I'll have a go at trying to duplicate what's happening on your 
end here. I want to make sure I know how to best duplicate the errors.

Thanks again,

Rick Kunath
