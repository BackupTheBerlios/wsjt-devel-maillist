<PRE>Hi Bruce,

Good job on your Mac successes!

&gt;<i> WSPR:  I've backported the endian changes to the wspr branch (except for 
</I>&gt;<i> getfile).  It's a pain to have diverged code like that; it would seem to 
</I>&gt;<i> make sense to build wspr out of the trunk along side wsjt so that 
</I>&gt;<i> algorithm improvements go into both.  
</I>
Yes, there are some pains related to the structure of our 
code tree.  Do keep in mind that at present we have some 
significant differences between what's wanted for WSPR (the 
program) and for WSPR-mode in WSJT.  Among these are the 
following:

1. WSPR uses 12000 Hz sampling.  WSJT, alas, uses 11025 Hz. 
  It would be better use 12000 Hz everywhere now, ... but 
that means a lot of changes in WSJT.  I haven't yet felt the 
time was right for making this major change.

2. For its beacon-like purposes, WSPR wants to decode all 
the signals it finds in a narrow band segment, currently 200 
Hz.  For making QSOs, WSJT may want to focus on signals 
within &quot;Tol&quot; of the &quot;Freeze DF&quot;.

&gt;<i> Tx works perfectly fine, but Rx is 
</I>&gt;<i> not decoding correctly....sync, snr, and freq identification are all 
</I>&gt;<i> good, but somewhere from decode162 on isn't working, as everything comes 
</I>&gt;<i> out undecodable ('*** ??? ***').  Fano seems to see the signals OK (low 
</I>&gt;<i> cycle count when processing), but but that's as far as I got. My WSPRing 
</I>&gt;<i> on 30m right now is from the Mac, and it's being copied well.
</I>
Hmmm...

Present versions of wqencode.f90 and wqdecode.f90 should be 
copied from trunk into the wspr branch, but I don't think 
that's your problem.  If the Fano cycle count is low it has 
almost certainly decoded the 50-bit binary message 
correctly.  It sounds like something is amiss when unpacking 
those 50 bits to produce human-readable messages?

&gt;<i> WSJT:  I've only tried JT65A.  JT65A receives and decodes fine, and 
</I>&gt;<i> seems to Tx OK.  However, I'm getting bogus DFs in some places, and 
</I>&gt;<i> certainly when I click in the spectrum to try to decode something, the 
</I>&gt;<i> resulting df is bogus.  I haven't looked at that at all, but probably 
</I>&gt;<i> simple.  John, do you see that as well?
</I>
Hope I didn't break something with all my messing around to 
put WSPR mode into WSJT.  I don't think I've seen this when 
running here, but I'll watch for such problems.

&gt;<i> I am heading on vacation for much of the next two weeks starting Sunday, 
</I>&gt;<i> so not sure how much farther I will get.  I may check in the wspr branch 
</I>&gt;<i> changes later today, but I was hoping to get decoding working again first!
</I>
Seems like we're all planning holidays soon.  I'll be around 
for most of July, but gone for most of August.
