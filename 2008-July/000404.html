I agree with you but it is reality on my computer.

&gt;<i> What I suppose you mean is that you are unable to compile WSJT with 
</I>&gt;<i> gfortran in the particular Debian Testing installation that you have put

</I>
Debian testing is wide spread distribution. WSJT should work on it as on
all major Linux distributions. This is only my personal oppinion.

&gt;<i> You said &quot;This was reported too.&quot;  Do you mean that you reported your 
</I>&gt;<i> problem to someone connected with the Debian release?
</I>
My mistake. I know Hamish VK3SB is reading. Just wanted to help a Debian
developer with my beta testing. I should use another listserver for the
purpoce.

&gt;<i> Did you do 
</I>&gt;<i> anything to try to determine exactly what is broken, and report that to 
</I>&gt;<i> them as well?
</I>
I am obviously missing the point. As you know I am not a developer. I
did install several different Linux distributions just to beta test wsjt
under Linux. I do not know how to repare wsjt. But I know how it should
behave. My reference always is the last Windows wsjt release. I am
experienced WSJT operator who is practicing every day. I always thought
that I do help with beta testing. I never expected that I will make you
nervous when I report that WSJT is unusable under Linux today as it does
not work under major Linux distributions like Mandriva, Fedora, Ubuntu,
Debian (fresh installed but not updated from elder releases).

Take my appologies. I will keep silence. It is clear that my beta
testing reports are not wellcome. I am ready to do any tests on request
if you or one from the team needs.

73, Harry LZ1BB
