Yes, a nice thought.

However the Mandriva fftw libs have never, going back a lot of years, 
ever been built correctly with the Fortran shims, so rebuilding with the 
--enable-type-prefix option is required now (for the double and the 
float/single versions of fftw, this is a single set of rpm packages in 
Mandriva containing both precisions of fftw). I've brought this to the 
attention of packagers, but no changes yet, and I'm not holding my 
breath waiting for any.

Several other Linux ham packages require the rebuilding of the FLTK libs 
with the xft option to prevent ugly fonts in Mandriva. I've never been 
able to get the package maintainer to make that change either, even 
though it has no ill effects.

At least on Mandriva there are a few things that need to be rebuilt from 
source rpms.

</I>&gt;<i> Can you tell me how long WSPR is running on your computer without crash

</I>
I had it running with the deep search option selected for 12 hours with 
no crashes, but I'll keep testing more later on today. I did a fresh 
checkout after deleting the SVN subdirectory for WSPR last night before 
running the tests.

Any chance you might be having memory issues? Have you run memtest or 
some other extended memory test on the machine just to rule memory 
issues out?

Let me know if there is anything else I can try locally that might help out.
