<PRE>I am sorry to break you but it will not be so easy to make a deb package
for Ubuntu 8.04. The reason is python-numpy ver 1.1.0 used in Ubuntu. So
one must be developer to change the code of WSJT to fix python-numpy
problem or to wait until the wsjt code is fixed by developers. Becide
python-numpy package there is  another problem with gfortran now. Not a
big deal as a deb maker could use g95. I used g95 in the rpm package
which was proved to work on several major past rpm based distributions
But in any case the posibilities are two. One to be good developer or to
wait untill wsjt code is fixed according the new distribution's
requirements.

</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Hi Richard,
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; From the information you've provided, it's impossible to 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;tell where your attempt to compile WSJT r386 on Ubuntu 8.04 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;went astray.  As I think you know, a number of Python 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;packages and other pre-requisites need to be installed 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;before you can compile Audio.so.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;The file wsjtrc is part of the distribution; it is not 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&quot;created&quot; when you run WSJT.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;It would be nice to have a few knowledgeable volunteers who 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;can create complete installable packages for released 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;versions of WSJT (and also WSPR and MAP65), targeted at the 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;most popular distributions/platforms of Linux, FreeBSD, and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;Macintosh.  Right now we don't always have that luxury, and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;the core development team is busy with other enhancement and 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;maintenance issues that we consider important.  If you want 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;to roll your own, on a *nix distribution that none of us 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;regularly uses, you're on your own ... or should ask for 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;help from others who have already succeeded.  To my 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;knowledge, there is no modern *nix distribution on which 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;WSJT cannot be made to run.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;	-- 73, Joe, K1JT

</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm not sure if I fully understand your message or the way you want it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; interpreted, .
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I'm very sorry to have wasted your time, as I did not realise that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Ubuntu was a distribution that no one uses.
