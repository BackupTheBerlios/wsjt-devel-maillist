<PRE>I've jumped over to Mac development for the time being, thanks to the 
progress made by John G4KLA.  I am finally able to build and run WSPR 
and WJST on OSX using a G5 (big-endian) Mac. 

I finally punted on the macports tool chain, as I fully determined that 
the python crashing issues I had before had nothing to do our code, as I 
could replicate it with a relatively short Tkinter/Pmw test program.  So 
now I'm using the stock leopard python, upgrading to numpy 1.0.4 and PIL 
1.1.6.  I'm using gfortran built for the architecture, and the stock gcc 
for the C pieces.

WSPR:  I've backported the endian changes to the wspr branch (except for 
getfile).  It's a pain to have diverged code like that; it would seem to 
make sense to build wspr out of the trunk along side wsjt so that 
algorithm improvements go into both.  Tx works perfectly fine, but Rx is 
not decoding correctly....sync, snr, and freq identification are all 
good, but somewhere from decode162 on isn't working, as everything comes 
out undecodable ('*** ??? ***').  Fano seems to see the signals OK (low 
cycle count when processing), but but that's as far as I got. My WSPRing 
on 30m right now is from the Mac, and it's being copied well.

WSJT:  I've only tried JT65A.  JT65A receives and decodes fine, and 
seems to Tx OK.  However, I'm getting bogus DFs in some places, and 
certainly when I click in the spectrum to try to decode something, the 
resulting df is bogus.  I haven't looked at that at all, but probably 
simple.  John, do you see that as well?

I am heading on vacation for much of the next two weeks starting Sunday, 
so not sure how much farther I will get.  I may check in the wspr branch 
changes later today, but I was hoping to get decoding working again first!
