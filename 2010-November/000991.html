<PRE>Hi Joe and Sivan and others,

1.  On-screen indicator?    Yes

2.   Ability to save/restore setups?    Yes

3.   Do we need separate Tx sliders?  Yes, definitely.  See (5) below.

4.   Write freq change to ALL_MEPT.TXT?     Ok

5.    Full random?     No.
        I don't think this is necessary.    I would cycle through  
each band-plan in turn.     The time for this complete cycle is  
unlikely to be more than 10 to 14 minutes.    What is the advantage  
in randomizing this?     For a given band-selection, I don't see the  
need for a random decision to transmit or not.    I would select the  
TX slider to 50% and then expect that at every alternate selection of  
this band, transmit would be selected.    If 25% then every 4th time  
round; 100% then every time the band was selected, transmit would be  
enabled.   This gives the user full control of how often transmission  
would take place on any given band.    I found the randomize scheme  
meant that I could never know when a transmission would occur.

6.   Automatic ATUs?    My Kenwood TS870  has a memory for each band  
and ATU selection takes a fraction of a second on a band change.    
When this is not available, then I agree that it would be difficult  
(impossible) to incorporate every possibility of ATU in the program  
and the user_hardware scheme would have to be used.

7.   Labels on the waterfall?  Yes please.   I agree with Sivan.   At  
the top rather than above the time stamp.

8.   Band map?    Hmmmm.    This is not easy - I don't have a useful  
suggestion.  All the information is, in any case, in the text box.

--- John  G4KLA
