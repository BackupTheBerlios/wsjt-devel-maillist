<PRE>Hi all,

Having run WSPR for a couple of days with band-hopping enabled in 
various configurations, I have some thoughts to share for your 
consideration.  They are in no particular order... just the order in 
which I made my notes.

1. Maybe there should be an on-screen indicator (or checkbox) that shows 
whether hopping is enabled.

2. Ability to save/restore hopping setups.

3. To consider: do we need separate &quot;Tx %&quot; sliders for each band?  An 
alternative would be to use the main slider for all bands, except that 
some bands could be marked &quot;Rx Only&quot;.

4. Write frequency-change information to ALL_MEPT.TXT ?

5. Fully random, no-memory selection of band and Tx/Rx state at the end 
of each two minute interval may be &quot;too random&quot;.  For example, it may 
take a long time -- far longer than the predictable average -- before 
you transmit on a particular band among all those selected.  I can think 
of many possible alternative scheduling algorithms.  For example: when 
hopping is selected or changed, randomly choose a sequence in which the 
N bands will be cycled through.  Each band would be visited exactly once 
per cycle.  After a band change, the first period will always be Tx 
(unless that band is Rx Only).  (This allows an automatic antenna tuner 
to do its thing.)  Unless Tx % is set to 100%, the Tx period will then 
be followed by M Rx periods, where M = (100/pctx) -1.  Occasionally 
(maybe 1/4 of the time?) M should be increased or decreased by 1, in a 
random way, to break up any possible &quot;resonances&quot; with the scheduling of 
another WSPR station.  After the M Rx periods, it's on to the next band.

6. How best to take advantage of automatic antenna tuners?  The one I've 
been using is truly automatic: if SNR &gt; 3 at the start of a 
transmission, it tunes to achieve SWR &lt; 1.5 in the first 1-4 seconds. 
No special &quot;tune&quot; transmission is required.  Tuners with 
frequency-lookup tables would be even better.

7. Should we put band labels on the wsterfall, maybe just above the time 
stamps?

8. Maybe the band-map needs to be re-thought.  At present it lists tha 
stations heard in the last hour, in oprder of frequency, and it's 
cleared on any band change.  With frequency hopping it might be better 
not to clear window when the frequency changes, and to label the entries 
by band?

Thats all for now.  I suggest that we work through some of these things, 
and any other suggestions made here, before we turn &quot;WSPR 2.5&quot; (or 
whatever it should be called) loose on a much larger group of users.

Comments welcome!
