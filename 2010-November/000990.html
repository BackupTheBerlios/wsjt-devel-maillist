<PRE>Hi Sivan and all,

&gt;&gt;<i> 2. Ability to save/restore hopping setups.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that's needed. My thinking was that it might be best to delay this
</I>&gt;<i> until we decide on what the setup should include, but I can add this now.
</I>
I'm happy to wait for this.  Your instinct was a good one.

&gt;&gt;<i> 3. To consider: do we need separate &quot;Tx %&quot; sliders for each band?  An
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> alternative would be to use the main slider for all bands, except that some
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bands could be marked &quot;Rx Only&quot;.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I added a slider for each band for two reasons. One is that some users might
</I>&gt;<i> be able to receive on bands on which they might not be able to transmit. For
</I>&gt;<i> example, a 10/15/20m triband beam might also able to do an acceptable job at
</I>&gt;<i> receiving on 18MHz, 24MHz, and maybe 40m, but you might not want to transmit
</I>&gt;<i> on these bands. My own softrock RXTX can receive on 20m/30m/40m, but I can
</I>&gt;<i> only transmit on 20m and 30m, because the output lowpass filter does not
</I>&gt;<i> filter the second harmonic on 40m.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other reason is that on popular bands, like 20m/30m/40m, it makes sense
</I>&gt;<i> to transmit less frequently, to let everybody a chance to be heard. But in a
</I>&gt;<i> band that's dead most of the time (say 10m) you can transmit more, and also
</I>&gt;<i> on bands on which there are few WSPR operators, at least in your region.
</I>
Understood.  I agree that there are some good reasons to set pctx by 
band.  An &quot;Rx only&quot; checkbox addresses your first point, but not the second.

&gt;&gt;<i> 6. How best to take advantage of automatic antenna tuners?  The one I've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> been using is truly automatic: if SNR&gt;  3 at the start of a transmission, it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> tunes to achieve SWR&lt;  1.5 in the first 1-4 seconds. No special &quot;tune&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> transmission is required.  Tuners with frequency-lookup tables would be even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> better.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two people wrote to me to say that Elecraft radios and the FT-450 with built
</I>&gt;<i> in ATUs apply tuner settings from memory when you switch frequencies even if
</I>&gt;<i> you don't transmit. This is probably true for other radios with ATUs and for
</I>&gt;<i> ATUs that are controlled digitally by the radio.
</I>
We could leavethis for everyone to deal with on his own, via the 
&quot;user_hardware&quot; program or script.  However, it's likely that many 
people won't be able to do this.

&gt;&gt;<i> 7. Should we put band labels on the wsterfall, maybe just above the time
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> stamps?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm in favor. I constantly try to figure out which stripe on the waterfall
</I>&gt;<i> belongs to whic band. We could also put it on the top of the strip, rather
</I>&gt;<i> than atop the time stamp.
</I>
Sure, that would be OK.
