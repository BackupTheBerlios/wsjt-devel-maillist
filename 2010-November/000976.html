I have solved my old WSPR problem by using the ALSA loopback sound card
mechanism under Ubuntu 10.04 and Ubuntu 10.10. (it did not work with
alsa-1.0.20 under Ubuntu 9.04 )

The ALSA Loopback sound card is a virtual soundcard that is created once
the ALSA kernel module snd-aloop is loaded. This virtual soundcard
device, as its name indicates, sends back the output signal of
applications using this card back to itself, so one has a chance to e.g.
record this signal from this virtual device.

In my case, I routed the output of Linrad to Loopback PCM (hw:3,0) and I
connected the WSPR input to Loopback PCM (hw:3,1). This configuration
seems to work pretty well with the blocking I/O's from WSPR 2.01 :-)

In your case, I would try the following configuratin:
Install snd-aloop and make sure that Loopback PCM (hw:3,0) is present in
the qjackctrl connection list.
Then I would try to connect the output of Dttsp to Loopback PCM (hw:3,0)
using qjackctrl.
Finally I would start WSPR and define Loopback PCM (hw:3,1) as its
input.

There is generic tutorial about snd-aloop and jack at:

The only problem I encountered was related to the compilation of the
snd-aloop.ko module:
I needed several attempts before I managed to successfully compile
alsadriver-1.0.21  under Ubuntu 10.04 .

Later on I discovered a much easier apt-based solution for getting the
precompiled  snd-aloop.ko module under Ubuntu 10.04 and Ubuntu 10.10:

Hope it helps.

</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; I compiled WSPR on my Ubuntu system which has portaudio with
</I>&gt;<i>         Jack
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; installed.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; When I start Jack and WSPR I can indeed select jack as an
</I>&gt;<i>         input or
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; output device for WSPR (if the jack server is started with
</I>&gt;<i>         the right
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; sample-rate=12000 and frames-per-period=2048 ). 
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; However there is no WSPR client visible in the &quot;connect&quot; box
</I>&gt;<i>         of
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; qjackctl. As a consequence, I cannot connect the output of
</I>&gt;<i>         Linrad to the
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; input of WSPR.
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; I think that the reason is that the sound.c module in WSPR
</I>&gt;<i>         is using
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; portaudio in &quot;blocking I/O&quot;-mode instead of callback-mode.
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         This sounds plausible to me. WSPR does use blocking I/O for 
</I>&gt;<i>         its calls to PortAudio; WSJT, MAP65, and MPA65-IQ use 
</I>&gt;<i>         callback mode. There is no particularly good reason for 
</I>&gt;<i>         this distinction. It came about when I was first writing 
</I>&gt;<i>         WSPR; I wanted to try the &quot;other&quot; PortAudio method, to see 
</I>&gt;<i>         what advantages/disadvantages there might be.
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         If there turns out to be a good reason to convert WSPR to 
</I>&gt;<i>         using the callback method, this could certainly be done.
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         Do take note of the fact that starting with r1628, WSPR is 
</I>&gt;<i>         using 48 kHz sampling instead of 12 kHz.
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         Most of the WSPR code assumes a 12 kHz sample rate. I had 
</I>&gt;<i>         thought that this would be a good match to nearly all of 
</I>&gt;<i>         today's sound cards, which could use their 48 kHz native 
</I>&gt;<i>         sample rate and do an easy filter/decimation stage to 
</I>&gt;<i>         produce the 12 kHz samples requested by WSPR. I was 
</I>&gt;<i>         astonished to learn from G3ZOD that when WSPR is started on 
</I>&gt;<i>         a machine with a Delta44 sound card, Windows (or the Delta44 
</I>&gt;<i>         driver?) sets its hardware sample rate to 44100 Hz (not 
</I>&gt;<i>         48000 Hz!) and then does a relative poor sample-rate 
</I>&gt;<i>         conversion to produce the 12000 Hz samples. Aarrgghh!
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         So maybe it will be more reliable to have WSPR (and 
</I>&gt;<i>         eventually WSJT?) sample at 48 kHz, and do any rate 
</I>&gt;<i>         conversions myself.
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; I will drop this question on the portaudio mailinglist to
</I>&gt;<i>         get it
</I>&gt;<i>         &gt; confirmed, unless someone else from this list can do it.
</I>&gt;<i>         
</I>&gt;<i>         Good idea. I will look forward to hearing what you learn.
