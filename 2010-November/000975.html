<PRE>Hi Everyone,

I want to run WSJT from sdr-core (Dttsp) which uses Jack.  I tried it 
today, and I don't find WSJT in the qjackctrl connection list, but I do 
see Dttsp and system (which are the jack I/O) as  inputs and outputs I 
can choose from.  The problem is that the sound data doesn't seem to 
really get connected properly, because the audio level is at -38 db and 
doesn't go up and down as I increase the volume coming from sdr-core.  I 
was using 48 KHz and the .deb for WSPR 2.11 as of today.

Does anyone have any pointers for me?  It appears that this has been 
discussed here before (see the thread quoted below), but possibly hasn't 
really been resolved.  Perhaps the next step is for me to download the 
code and build it so I can put some debugging statements in to see what 
seems to be amiss, but first perhaps some of you wise ones can give me 
some tips as to where to go poking.

Thanks &amp; 73,

Rob

    Hi Pierre,

     &gt;/When I start Jack and WSPR I can indeed select jack as an input or/

     &gt;/However there is no WSPR client visible in the &quot;connect&quot; box of/

    to the/
     &gt;/input of WSPR./
     &gt;//
     &gt;/I think that the reason is that the sound.c module in WSPR is using/
     &gt;/portaudio in &quot;blocking I/O&quot;-mode instead of callback-mode./

    This sounds plausible to me. WSPR does use blocking I/O for
    its calls to PortAudio; WSJT, MAP65, and MPA65-IQ use
    callback mode. There is no particularly good reason for
    this distinction. It came about when I was first writing
    WSPR; I wanted to try the &quot;other&quot; PortAudio method, to see
    what advantages/disadvantages there might be.

    If there turns out to be a good reason to convert WSPR to
    using the callback method, this could certainly be done.

    Do take note of the fact that starting with r1628, WSPR is
    using 48 kHz sampling instead of 12 kHz.

    Most of the WSPR code assumes a 12 kHz sample rate. I had
    thought that this would be a good match to nearly all of
    today's sound cards, which could use their 48 kHz native
    sample rate and do an easy filter/decimation stage to
    produce the 12 kHz samples requested by WSPR. I was
    astonished to learn from G3ZOD that when WSPR is started on
    a machine with a Delta44 sound card, Windows (or the Delta44
    driver?) sets its hardware sample rate to 44100 Hz (not
    48000 Hz!) and then does a relative poor sample-rate
    conversion to produce the 12000 Hz samples. Aarrgghh!

    So maybe it will be more reliable to have WSPR (and
    eventually WSJT?) sample at 48 kHz, and do any rate
    conversions myself.

     &gt;/I will drop this question on the portaudio mailinglist to get it/
     &gt;/confirmed, unless someone else from this list can do it./

    Good idea. I will look forward to hearing what you learn.
