<PRE>Hi Sivan,

Thanks for tackling this important task!  As you note, antenna tuning 
(or switching) will be an issue that many will need to face when they 
try WSPR in a frequency-hopping mode.  However, hams are inventive and 
resourceful...  and many will figure out how to do it.  We may wand to 
do something like writing band-switching information into a simple text 
file that can be read by another program -- unique to each station -- 
that takes care of switching a few relays, etc.  We may also want to 
enhance the CAT commands to include activating built-in antenna tuners, 
for rigs that have them.

Your choice of operating controls and scheduling algorithms sound like 
an excellent start.  By all means, go ahead and commit your changes!  I 
look forward to trying it out.

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
