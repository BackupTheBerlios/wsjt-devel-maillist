<PRE>Some comments on some of the issues.

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Having run WSPR for a couple of days with band-hopping enabled in various
</I>&gt;<i> configurations, I have some thoughts to share for your consideration.  They
</I>&gt;<i> are in no particular order... just the order in which I made my notes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Maybe there should be an on-screen indicator (or checkbox) that shows
</I>&gt;<i> whether hopping is enabled.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Good idea. In general I think that an explicit control (for enabling
hopping) is better than the current implicit control in which hopping is
enabled if you check any of the band checkboxes.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Ability to save/restore hopping setups.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Yes, that's needed. My thinking was that it might be best to delay this
until we decide on what the setup should include, but I can add this now.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. To consider: do we need separate &quot;Tx %&quot; sliders for each band?  An
</I>&gt;<i> alternative would be to use the main slider for all bands, except that some
</I>&gt;<i> bands could be marked &quot;Rx Only&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I added a slider for each band for two reasons. One is that some users might
be able to receive on bands on which they might not be able to transmit. For
example, a 10/15/20m triband beam might also able to do an acceptable job at
receiving on 18MHz, 24MHz, and maybe 40m, but you might not want to transmit
on these bands. My own softrock RXTX can receive on 20m/30m/40m, but I can
only transmit on 20m and 30m, because the output lowpass filter does not
filter the second harmonic on 40m.

The other reason is that on popular bands, like 20m/30m/40m, it makes sense
to transmit less frequently, to let everybody a chance to be heard. But in a
band that's dead most of the time (say 10m) you can transmit more, and also
on bands on which there are few WSPR operators, at least in your region.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Write frequency-change information to ALL_MEPT.TXT ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>

&gt;<i> 5. Fully random, no-memory selection of band and Tx/Rx state at the end of
</I>&gt;<i> each two minute interval may be &quot;too random&quot;.  For example, it may take a
</I>&gt;<i> long time -- far longer than the predictable average -- before you transmit
</I>&gt;<i> on a particular band among all those selected.  I can think of many possible
</I>&gt;<i> alternative scheduling algorithms.  For example: when hopping is selected or
</I>&gt;<i> changed, randomly choose a sequence in which the N bands will be cycled
</I>&gt;<i> through.  Each band would be visited exactly once per cycle.  After a band
</I>&gt;<i> change, the first period will always be Tx (unless that band is Rx Only).
</I>&gt;<i>  (This allows an automatic antenna tuner to do its thing.)  Unless Tx % is
</I>&gt;<i> set to 100%, the Tx period will then be followed by M Rx periods, where M =
</I>&gt;<i> (100/pctx) -1.  Occasionally (maybe 1/4 of the time?) M should be increased
</I>&gt;<i> or decreased by 1, in a random way, to break up any possible &quot;resonances&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> with the scheduling of another WSPR station.  After the M Rx periods, it's
</I>&gt;<i> on to the next band.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6. How best to take advantage of automatic antenna tuners?  The one I've
</I>&gt;<i> been using is truly automatic: if SNR &gt; 3 at the start of a transmission, it
</I>&gt;<i> tunes to achieve SWR &lt; 1.5 in the first 1-4 seconds. No special &quot;tune&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> transmission is required.  Tuners with frequency-lookup tables would be even
</I>&gt;<i> better.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Two people wrote to me to say that Elecraft radios and the FT-450 with built
in ATUs apply tuner settings from memory when you switch frequencies even if
you don't transmit. This is probably true for other radios with ATUs and for
ATUs that are controlled digitally by the radio.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 7. Should we put band labels on the wsterfall, maybe just above the time
</I>&gt;<i> stamps?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'm in favor. I constantly try to figure out which stripe on the waterfall
belongs to whic band. We could also put it on the top of the strip, rather
than atop the time stamp.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 8. Maybe the band-map needs to be re-thought.  At present it lists tha
</I>&gt;<i> stations heard in the last hour, in oprder of frequency, and it's cleared on
</I>&gt;<i> any band change.  With frequency hopping it might be better not to clear
</I>&gt;<i> window when the frequency changes, and to label the entries by band?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thats all for now.  I suggest that we work through some of these things,
</I>&gt;<i> and any other suggestions made here, before we turn &quot;WSPR 2.5&quot; (or whatever
</I>&gt;<i> it should be called) loose on a much larger group of users.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Comments welcome!
