<PRE>Is everyone comfortable with the idea of releasing a beta version of 
WSPR 2.2 (or whatever we should call it) with frequency hopping?  It 
will surely continue to evolve, as the program always has done, but it's 
stable abd very usable.  Opening it to use by others should generate 
some useful input.


For reference, here's my own experience over the past week.  Frequency 
hopping works well with my setup.  I've been doing 10-12-15-17-20-30m 
during daylight, shifting to 20-30-40-80-160m at night.

I've configured user_hardware.py to switch among three different antennas:

1. 160m: shunt-fed 21m tower (EME array and many VHF/UHF yagis on top)
2. 80-40-30-17-12m: 25m dipole at 15m, fed with open-wire line
3. 20-25-10m: trap dipole at 10m

An LDG auto-tuner activates itself and re-tunes antenna #2 during the 
first few seconds of any transmission on a new band using that antenna.

I have thought a bit more about the randomization of band selection and 
T/R sequences.  As I mentioned before, I think that truly random, wholly 
uncorrelated band selection may be &quot;too random&quot; for our purpose.  A 
better model might be something closer to shuffling a deck of cards.  We 
have one &quot;card&quot; for each of N bands, and do a random shuffle to choose 
the order in which they will be visited.  When N-1 bands have already 
been visited, there's nothing random about which band will come next -- 
but quite possibly that's what we want.  Similarly, perhaps, for chosing 
whether to Rx or Tx in a given sequence.  If I have selected pctx=25 and 
have already done 3 Rx sequences, I probably want to Tx in the next 
sequence on this band.

Comments?
