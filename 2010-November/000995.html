<PRE>Hi,

Caution....!!!

During WSPR operation yesterday and today I have experienced a  
problem with rigctl  which could have unfortunate consequences.

rigctl is supposed to exit with a non-zero status as follows:

EXIT STATUS
        rigctl exits with:
        0 if all operations completed normally;
        1 if there was an invalid command line option or argument;
        2 if an error was returned by Hamlib.

I have found that this is not always true and the exit status can be  
0.  Example:

hopping to  60 m  Tx Fraction  0
hopping to  17 m  Tx Fraction  20
set_freq: error = Invalid parameter

In this case, the exit status is zero, not 1.  The band change has  
failed and the 60m band is still selected.    (The set_freq error  
seems to be due to an intermittent communication glitch with the  
transmitter when a read command fails during the set-freq  
sequence.    Not yet resolved.).

The exit status is 0 and therefore in this case wspr believes the  
band has been changed to 17m whereas 60m is still selected.   Should  
wspr decide to TX on this cycle then, in the UK, an illegal  
transmission will occur since the 60m band is only available with  
special permission from the licensing authority.    (I guess  
something similar in the USA.)   Bad news...

This is NOT a problem with wspr.   I have proved that this fault can  
be provoked from time to time by repeatedly using the rigctl command  
manually.   I have reported this problem (with examples) to the  
hamlib-developer site but thought a warning here might be  
appropriate.   The solution from hamlib-developer is to ensure that a  
non-zero status is ALWYS returned in case of trouble and then WSPR  
takes care about what to do next.

John
