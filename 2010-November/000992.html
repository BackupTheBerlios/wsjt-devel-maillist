<PRE>I have comments to both John and Joe regarding the hopping and T/R
scheduling.

Some randomization is necessary, and we probably need a lot of
randomization, not just a bit. Suppose Johns the schedule to 20% Tx on 40m,
30m and 20m, which with no randomization will result in a cycle of 15
periods (1/2 hour), 5 on each band, starting with a Tx on each band. I set
the schedule to 20% on 10m, 15m, and 20m. There are 15 ways for my cycle to
align with John's. In only 9 of them there will be any overlap between our
occupancy of 20m, and in 1 of the 9 we won't hear each other because we'll
always transmit at the same time. In the other 8 out of 9, one of us will
hear the other but not vice versa. That's not good.

Joe's suggestion had some randomness but not much (25% chance for an extra
or missing Rx cycle on each band to generate some jitter, and a random
ordering of bands). My intuition is that it is more likely to result in long
stretches of time where I and another station meet on the air than total
randomization, but I didn't do the analysis.

When somebody decides to hop, it essentially means that a &quot;full cycle&quot; gets
much longer. Now a full cycle is a Tx period followed by Rx periods on some
band. It can be 10 or 20 minutes before WSPR repeats itself (transmits
again). With hopping, this will get longer. I think it means that people
will be even less likely to stare at the GUI or wsprnet.org than they are
now. They will check every hour or so what's going on, or will leave the
setup running overnight and will check in the morning. In this usage mode,
the feeling of control that John talked about is less important, I think.

If we go with Joe's suggestion, we need to consider two difficulties, one
with the UI and one with the software engineering. Both are solvable, but it
would be good to discuss them before starting to hack.

The UI question is when to create a new schedule. With total randomization,
the program is very responsive to the GUI (and hence to the user). If you
check or uncheck a band on the hopping panel or change the Tx fraction of
some band, the next 2-minute period will already take account of the new
setting when tossing the band and T/R coins. If the schedule has state, like
the band permutation and the number of Rx cycles we decided to do for the
current band, then you need to decide how to react when the user changes the
setting. A complicated solution will try to see if it's possible to modify
the existing state, say by dropping a band from the permutation. But it can
get a bit complicated, say if we are currently on the band that's being
dropped. Perhaps a sensible solution is to throw out all the state and
compute a completely new schedule every time the user touches the hopping
settings.

The other consideration is the fact that scheduling is distributed between
wspr.py and wspr2.f90. The former decides on band changes (I did this
because that's where manual band changes were made, and because only wspr.py
knows which bands exist). The latter decides on Tx vs. Rx. We can still
implement any kind of strategy, but the split responsibilities will add some
complexity to the code.

&gt;<i> Hi Joe and Sivan and others,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1.  On-screen indicator?    Yes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2.   Ability to save/restore setups?    Yes
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3.   Do we need separate Tx sliders?  Yes, definitely.  See (5) below.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4.   Write freq change to ALL_MEPT.TXT?     Ok
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5.    Full random?     No.
</I>&gt;<i>       I don't think this is necessary.    I would cycle through each
</I>&gt;<i> band-plan in turn.     The time for this complete cycle is unlikely to be
</I>&gt;<i> more than 10 to 14 minutes.    What is the advantage in randomizing this?
</I>&gt;<i>   For a given band-selection, I don't see the need for a random decision to
</I>&gt;<i> transmit or not.    I would select the TX slider to 50% and then expect that
</I>&gt;<i> at every alternate selection of this band, transmit would be selected.    If
</I>&gt;<i> 25% then every 4th time round; 100% then every time the band was selected,
</I>&gt;<i> transmit would be enabled.   This gives the user full control of how often
</I>&gt;<i> transmission would take place on any given band.    I found the randomize
</I>&gt;<i> scheme meant that I could never know when a transmission would occur.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6.   Automatic ATUs?    My Kenwood TS870  has a memory for each band and
</I>&gt;<i> ATU selection takes a fraction of a second on a band change.   When this is
</I>&gt;<i> not available, then I agree that it would be difficult (impossible) to
</I>&gt;<i> incorporate every possibility of ATU in the program and the user_hardware
</I>&gt;<i> scheme would have to be used.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 7.   Labels on the waterfall?  Yes please.   I agree with Sivan.   At the
</I>&gt;<i> top rather than above the time stamp.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 8.   Band map?    Hmmmm.    This is not easy - I don't have a useful
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion.  All the information is, in any case, in the text box.
