<PRE>Hi Everybody,

I have a working version of the WSPR frequency hopping feature that I am
planning to commit back to the repository. This email summarizes the changes
so people can comment on the design before I commit.

1. Right now the new feature is hidden, to allow some users to test it while
others don't see it at all. Also, most of the related python code is
conditioned on the feature being exposed, so bugs in the new code are not
likely to affect users who don't see the feature. To enable hopping, the
user needs to create a file hopping.txt in the WSPR directory.

2. If this file is there, a &quot;Frequency Hopping&quot; feature appears in the Setup
menu. Clicking on it opens a new panel that is implemented in a new python
source, WsprMod/hopping.py.

3. This panel has a checkbox for each frequency and a slider next to it, to
set the Tx fraction. This allows you to specify, say, that you want to hop
on 10m, 15m, 20m, 40m, and 80m, transmitting only on 10, 15, and 20, with
50% Tx on 10 and 15 but only 20% on 20m.

4. If you check any of the check boxes, WSPR's scheduling goes into hopping
mode, explained below. If none are checked, the scheduling (decision when to
transmit and when to receive) are exactly as they are now.

5. When hopping, wspr.py chooses in every Tx/Rx cycle on which band to be,
with equal probability to all the bands that are checked on the hopping
panel. It switches bands as soon as possible after the previous cycle ends.
When switching bands, it also changes the Tx fraction slider on the main
panel if necessary.

6. When hopping, wspr2.f90 uses a very simple strategy for deciding whether
to transmit or receive. It decides by generating a random number and testing
whether it is below the Tx fraction; if so, it transmits; otherwise, it
receives. If no hopping checkbox is marked, this code is disabled and the
current Tx/Rx code is used.

Other than these 3 sources, I also added two global variables in acom1.f90
and added 2 lines to modify them in tx.f90 and rx.f90.

I note that Martin G8JNJ wrote on the WSPR general forum that he implemented
hopping using external scrips, and that he needs a Tx cycle after every hop
in order to let his antenna tuner tune, so that reception benefits from a
tuned tuner. I am not sure how to implement this. I can do this by staying
on the same frequency for a few cycles, starting with Tx, but this will hurt
randomization and reduce the probability of rendezvous, or by transmitting
for a few seconds before the whole minute begins. I think that the best
course of action may be to release a simple version and see what test users
request and suggest.

I am ready to commit the changes.

Regards, Sivan
