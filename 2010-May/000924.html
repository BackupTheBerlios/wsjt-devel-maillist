<PRE>Just did a fresh install on Ubuntu 9.04 and I noticed a few things.

First, the complete package list that I needed to installed:

subversion
python-dev
python2.5-dev
python-imaging-tk
python-pmw
fftw3-dev
portaudio19-dev
libsamplerate0-dev
python-f2py
gfortran
python-dev

It wouldn't compile with just python2.5-dev, I ended up having to install
python-dev, which I believe is now 2.6....

Also, I noticed that Audio.so wasn't being copied (make install) to the
WsjtMod directory under:

/usr/local/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/WsjtMod/

I had to copy it over by hand. Not sure if that was appropriate or what, but
it was an oversight maybe we could update the Make/config scripts.

Also, on Ubutnu 9.04 python gets installed into /usr/bin, but it seems like
the default directory configure used was /usr/local which barfed up a bunch
of errors when calling the /usr/local/bin/wsjt script. The gist is that the
instal files went into /usr/local/share/wsjt, but since python was in
/usr/bin it looked for those files in /usr/share/wsjt. To get around it I
just made a symlink in /usr/local/bin/ to /usr/bin/python (which itself is a
symlink!).

Minor nits, I know, but maybe with some judicious adjustment of defaults we
can get more folks using the Linux version :)

I may attempt running it on 10.04, but I've had some stability issues on the
machine that it's been installed on. Seems like a widespread issue from
reading the forums, possible bad Intel video driver issues.
