<PRE>Diane's recent note about the coming official release of PortAudio v19 
prompts me to bring everyone up to date on what I've been doing.

My thoughts can be broken down

1. As you know, I have put a lot of work recently into MAP65, a sort -f 
&quot;big brother&quot; to WSJT specifically aimed at using JT65B for EME with the 
aid of a wideband SDR-style receiver.  MAP65 got a very thorough workout 
at K1JT during the recent ARRL EME Contest.  Although the program can 
still be improved in certain areas, it performed extremely well during 
the contest.  Although it originated as a branch from the WSJT &quot;trunk&quot;, 
and its source code is stored in a branch from the WSJT repository, 
MAP65 is really an independent program.

Although certain developments in the MAP65 code should be ported back 
into WSJT, there will never be a true &quot;merge&quot; of this branch back into 
the trunk.

Question: Should MAP65 be given its own repository at some point, 
terminating its &quot;branch&quot; in the WSJT tree?

2. My most recent changes to WSJT have been made in order to make it 
compile using free, open-source tools.  The most recent revision, r587, 
compiles under Windows using g95, gcc, and the MinGW tools -- as well as 
with the Compaq Visual Fortran and VC6.  I suspect that in doing this I 
have broken something so that it won't compile under Linux; I'll look 
into this soon, and fix whatever needs fixing.

As usual, comments and suggestions are welcome!

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
