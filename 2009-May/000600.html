<PRE>Here is a copy of a letter I got from Peter, DG6MAN. It might be of any
help concerning the gfortran problem. Actually I did mentioned that the
gfortran problem rose up after gcc was upgraded to 4.3 in Debian too.

Subject: Re: Managed to build and run wsjt-5.9.7.r386  on openSuSE 11.0

Hi Harry,

The credit for my success to build wsjt on openSuSE 11.0 goes to
malcolmlewis of the openSuSE forum.
He provided me with all the valuable advice to get it working.

In order to build wsjt-5.9.7.r386  on openSuSE 11.0 proceed as follows:

Assuming that make, Python, etc. are already installed following packages need
to be added to the system:

from <A HREF="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/gcc/openSUSE_11.0/i586">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/gcc/openSUSE_11.0/i586</A>
obtain the gcc41 components (gcc41, gcc41-fortran, etc.)
and install these tools and libraries.

Either remove the gcc43 suite or change the symbolic links, so that they point
to the tools of the gcc41 suite.

from <A HREF="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/hamradio/openSUSE_11.0/i586">http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/hamradio/openSUSE_11.0/i586</A>
obtain python-numpy and python-numpy-devel and install them.

Building wsjt with gcc43 works, but the binary fails to run
with a segmentation fault!

The simplest procedure is doing all these software installations
through YAST(resolution of dependencies, etc.).

Build wsjt and install it the way as described in your spec file written for
openSuSE 10.1, unfortunately it did not work for me on 11.0.

As soon as I have it working, I will send it to you, too.

In order to make the KVASD decoder work:
	-copy KVASD_gfortran to KVASD

  	-insert a line into the wrapper script, so that KVASD is copied
	 to the user's home directory upon invocation of wsjt.

As far as openSuSE 11.1 is concerned, stay away from this release.
It has Python v.2.16 in it and Python v.2.16 has a nasty bug,
which makes all and every interfacing with python-numpy fail.

As soon as I managed to upgrade my antenna from 7 elements under
my roof to a 22 elements group outside, I will show up in the DXer's
scene a bit more visible.

I resumed operations after a break of 28 years(personal reasons).
With my modest means as of now I already managed to get an an
ODX of 707km in tropo. :)
