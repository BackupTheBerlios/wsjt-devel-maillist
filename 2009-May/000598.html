<PRE>Here's an update on my tests with gfortran and (K)ubuntu 9.04.

1. I executed the automatic update procedures from Kubuntu 
8.04 to 8.10 and then 8.10 to 9.04. Kubuntu 9.04 looks very 
nice, and it runs as expected.  It is certainly not a 
&quot;disaster&quot;.

2. I had to make just two manual package additions: 
tcl8.5-dev and tk8.5-dev.

3. WSJT and WPSR compile and run properly with g95, and they 
look nice.  (K)ubuntu 9.04 has apparently done something 
good with the appearance of standard fonts.

4. Both WSJT and WSPR crash on startup if compiled with 
gfortran, just as they did in 8.04.

5. I spent about 8 hours trying to isolate the problem with 
gfortran, without much success.  I am left with a strong 
suspicion that it has to do with Fortran I/O in a 
multi-threaded environment, perhaps especially with internal 
read/write statements.  (These are the ones that involve 
formatted transfers to/from a character variable, but no I/O 
to a physical device.)  I could certainly be wrong about 
this... I haven't isolated a real &quot;smoking gun&quot;.

I am putting the problem aside for now.

As far as I know, there is no reason that a .deb package 
can't be made using the g95 compiler.  Maybe someone want to 
do this?  Or, maybe *nix users of these programs will need 
to compile their own from source code.  It's really not that 
hard -- Harry and others have spelled out all the necessary 
steps.

Comments?
