<PRE>Hi Jeff and all,

Yes, that has always been true.  Just make an empty one.  One of these 
days, I'll correct this minor flaw.

&gt;<i> Testing g95 produced a running map65.  Why does the last stage take so

It's a big program.  I suppose the optimizer is thinking things over.

For reference: here, on a somewhat elderly Linux machine it compiles in 
2.0 minutes.  On a somewhat newer Win/XP machine with MinGW it compiles 
in 1.4 minutes.

&gt;<i> Testing gfortran showed crashes.  Printf shows that it occurs after the

</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;after 1st...&quot; message.
</I>
This is our well-known problem with gfortran.  (See the wsjt-devel 
traffic earlier today, and earlier as well.)  Probably the same kind of 
fixes as those made today to WSJT will correct it.

For now, if you want a working program, use g95.  Or use the 
&quot;production&quot; version, on the WSJT web site, which is compiled with 
Compaq Visual Fortran.

MAP65 has a few rough edges.  The number of users is probably a few 
dozen, as opposed to the several thousand users of WSJT and WSPR.  As a 
consequence, given my limited time I don't feel the need for nearly as 
much &quot;polish&quot; as is warranted on the other programs.

I've been a heavy user of MAP65 for nearly two years, and a very happy 
one.  The program provides amazing capabilities for EME.
