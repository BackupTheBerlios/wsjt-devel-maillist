<PRE>While working on map65, patching various things for testing, I decided that
I'd better start over. A lot of stuff just wasn't working right.

I just did a fresh checkout of the whole r1250 tree and confirmed that
map65/configure doesn't generate a Makefile, but that wsjt8 and wsjt do
generate Makefiles.  This started about r1236 for me.

This may be related to installing g95 and removing and reinstalling
gfortran...but I can't think why.

I first noticed something was wrong when I installed g95 ran ./configure
--enable-g95 and the Makefile still contained references to gfortran.  I
thought it was a configure bug and patched the Makefile, but it really was a
problem with configure only generating configure.status, no Makefile.

diff'ing between two config files shows some differences with lines
containing &quot;ac_config_files&quot; and &quot;Makefile&quot;.

I was getting so, close.

Any ideas?
