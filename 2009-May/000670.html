<PRE>Hi Harry and all,

Thanks for reminding us that you found a combination of 
gfortran/gcc versions that produced a working WSJT, some 
time ago.  So have several others, including myself.

My recent goal has been to find out exactly what's wrong 
with code produced by current revisions of these compilers, 
and whether any of the problem can be traced to the 
architecture and implementation of WSJT itself.

An added impetus is that some *nix users -- yourself 
included -- like always to upgrade to the latest versions of 
available software.  If WSJT does not compile and run 
correctly with the latest revisions in popular *nix 
distributions, I'd like to understand why, and either fix it 
or submit a concise bug report to the GNU folks.

Unfortunately, I haven't succeeded in identifying the 
problem.  My statement on this reflector a couple of days 
ago, to the effect that &quot;the gfortran problem has been 
solved&quot; -- was premature.  When I tried the same things on 
WSPR that had worked with WSJT, they failed.  The problem 
definitely has to do with multi-threaded code and with 
Fortran read/write statements, perhaps especially internal 
formatted read/write statements.

Other than that general statement, I am still in the dark: 
gfortran versions of WSJT and WSPR can be compiled and run 
correctly on some Linux systems, but not all.  I believe 
they are always OK on FreeBSD, and compiling with g95 always 
seems to work.  On windows, MinGW/g95 and CVF are both OK.

We still have not found the root cause of the gfortran problem.

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
