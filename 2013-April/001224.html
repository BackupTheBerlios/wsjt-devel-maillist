Recognizing the problems with wider application of more versions  I 
think it might still be important to also recognize the potential value 
of non-HF modes to VHF/UHF+.  Originally the thought was that WSPR (2 
minute) was not useful *above* HF due to &quot;Doppler&quot;. As it turns out, 
this is emphatically not the case. In fact WSPR-15 out of WSJT-X works 
extremely well at 432 MHz as long as the rig accuracy/stability problem 
is dealt with properly. As a result, we now have a tool for digging 
quite deep into the noise at VHF-microwave.

At HF the ionosphere is moving and mushy such that energy is indeed 
spread such that it may may exceed the effective information bandwidth 
of many of these modes. However, at VHF, although aircraft influenced 
paths exist (ACS, AES and WTVs to name three), these generally do not 
cause a problem with functionality or usefulness of narrow modes. Very 
narrow received spectral line widths are obtainable on these higher 
bands and are allowing observation of previously unrecognized phenomena.

Consider this just a vote and praise for some of these other modes in an 
environment where there is always too much to do!
