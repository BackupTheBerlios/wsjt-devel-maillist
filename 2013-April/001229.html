<PRE>Hi all,

Progress today on WSJT-X:

1. Found and corrected a bug that could cause seemingly erratic crashes 
of the GUI -- probably the bug that has been reported a number of times 
recently.  It occurred when a message containing a compound callsign was 
decoded, e.g., &quot;DE R2DD/3 KO97&quot;.

2. Fixed several other minor bugs and annoyances, added two small 
buttons that set TxFreq=RxFreq and RxFreq=TxFreq, respectively, and 
added an option to &quot;Allow multiple instances&quot;.

I'd like to have a stable release of WSJT-X that we can call Version 1.0 
in the near future.  To that end, I'm thinking to release something 
close to revision 3209 as &quot;v0.95&quot;, with the understanding that we and 
our present user community would exercise it thoroughly for a short 
while (a week? two weeks?).  We would fix any reported bugs and then, if 
all is well, release the program (including a newly written manual) as 
Version 1.0.

Does this sound right to everyone here?  Any suggestions for last-minute 
additions?  Let us know how r3209 works for you.

One peculiarity is bugging me, right now.  Compiling WSJT-X in MinGW 
under Windows, if I uncomment the seemingly harmless declaration at line 
258 of mainwindow.h (r3209), the program then crashes on startup with an 
access violation.  Anybody have an idea what's going on???

	-- Joe, K1JT
