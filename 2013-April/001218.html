<PRE>I'd like to consult others on the general topic of &quot;What needs to be 
done before a formal release of WSJT-X Version 1.0?&quot;

As a bare minimum, my own short list includes the following essentials:

1. Complete recent work on rig control via calls to hamlib functions.

2. Track down and fix a recently reported bug that causes erratic 
crashed of the GUI.

3. Write a full User's Guide to replace the present early draft.

I'm presently working on all of these.  Are there other important 
program features that should be added, before a more formal release?

Please feel free to submit your (preferably prioritized) list!


One more thought.  As I'm sure you are aware, 99.9% of the use of WSJT-X 
is with the JT9-1 mode.  The other submodes (JT9-2 through JT9-30) were 
included as &quot;specialty modes&quot;, possibly useful on the MF and LF bands. 
There is little reason to use them at HF.

The WSJT-X code could be made somewhat simpler (and much smaller in 
memory requirements) if submodes JT9-2, ... JT9-30 were eliminated from 
the code going forward.  Do you have an opinion about the advisability 
of doing so?
