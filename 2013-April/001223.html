<PRE>Hi Joe,

I fully agree with your enumeration of tasks. One suggestion I have would
be to elect a production release after some testing time to allow us to
polish edges and eliminate serious bugs. We could have a list of features
to work on and once that is complete, we could switch to polishing and bug
hunting mode and once stability is achieved, we could promote a revision to
production. The production code base could then be used to build packages
and pre-compiled binaries. What do you think?

As you have stated, JT9-1 is becoming popular very fast on HF bands.
However, I am not 100% sure the other modes don't have their niche. Perhaps
the reason that they are not popular yet is that low band experimenters are
not yet familiar with them. I, myself, have introduced the JT9-X to a
couple of hams that like operating QRP on 160m. They were not at all aware
of the new modes. So... Since the current code base has all the modes
implemented, may be we could hold onto them for a little longer. We could
try to remediate the memory requirements issue with some programming.
Perhaps a command line argument for which mode to run -- having JT9-1 as a
default mode?

&gt;<i> I'd like to consult others on the general topic of &quot;What needs to be done

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As a bare minimum, my own short list includes the following essentials:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Complete recent work on rig control via calls to hamlib functions.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Track down and fix a recently reported bug that causes erratic crashed

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Write a full User's Guide to replace the present early draft.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm presently working on all of these.  Are there other important program

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please feel free to submit your (preferably prioritized) list!
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One more thought.  As I'm sure you are aware, 99.9% of the use of WSJT-X
</I>&gt;<i> is with the JT9-1 mode.  The other submodes (JT9-2 through JT9-30) were
</I>&gt;<i> included as &quot;specialty modes&quot;, possibly useful on the MF and LF bands.
</I>&gt;<i> There is little reason to use them at HF.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The WSJT-X code could be made somewhat simpler (and much smaller in memory
</I>&gt;<i> requirements) if submodes JT9-2, ... JT9-30 were eliminated from the code
</I>&gt;<i> going forward.  Do you have an opinion about the advisability of doing so?
