<PRE>Hi Diane,

Good to hear from you!

You have probably figured out that development efforts have been moved 
from the older Python-based-GUI version of WSJT to the Qt-based-GUI 
version called WSJT-X.  Presently WSJT-X supports only the mode JT9, but 
the idea is that other popular WSJT modes (JT65, JT4, ISCAT, FSK441) 
will be added in due course.

I hope that development of WSJT-X will soon reach a stable point 
(perhaps to be called version 1.0 ?) at which a formal release with 
smoothly functioning JT9 will make sense.  At that stage we should 
certainly make available a snapshot tarfile of the source, as well as 
binary installation packages for Windows, Debian-based linux, and 
possibly OS-X and other *nix distributions.

I would welcome comments from others on the best development procedures, 
going forward.

	-- Joe, K1JT
