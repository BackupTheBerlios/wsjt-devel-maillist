<PRE>Hi Joe, All,

Nice to work you on 20m last night with the new release.

I'm not seeing the issues some are posting about rig_control in&#160;regards&#160;to polling but I did have an app closure again last night, but this time, it was with CAT disabled on the configuration screen I have Commander polling set to&#160;Continuous&#160;Interrogation, Command&#160;Interval&#160;200ms, Scan Dwell 1 and No Interrogation when Transmitting. Review of the Commander error_log shows not errors.

I worked a few stations, and was playing around with new features. At QRT time, I left the it&#160;running&#160;in monitor mode on 20m. When I came out to the shack this morning, the app was closed down. JT-Alert-X, DXLab Commander and DXkeeper all still going. This&#160;happened&#160;on 3195 as well, but the the last 24hrs prior to upgrading I did not see it at all.


On this latest app closure, I used JT-Alert-X to Auto start / stop Commander 1st, DXkeeper 2nd and then WSJT-X, so CAT ./ rigctrl was via Commander. I'm not sure if rig_control plays a part in the&#160;closure&#160;or not, but was a change from my&#160;normal&#160;operating mode this time, so I noted it.

73's, Greg, KI7MT
