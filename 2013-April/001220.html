<PRE>Hi Joe, All,
My original e-mail wasn't as clear in writing as it was in my thoughts :-). Some clarification below: &gt;&gt;&gt; KI7MT
---------------------
-- Joe, K1JT Wrote
You have probably figured out that development efforts have been moved 
from the older Python-based-GUI version of WSJT to the Qt-based-GUI 
version called WSJT-X.  Presently WSJT-X supports only the mode JT9, but 
the idea is that other popular WSJT modes (JT65, JT4, ISCAT, FSK441) 
will be added in due course. 
---------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> KI7MT:  My original question was went to ask, how do we svn co the -r number(s), -r xxxx, for the different packages that were tagged as stable releases based on the WSJT site.
</I>I found the answers on how to accomplish this by RTM - Read The Manual :-) The missing element is, what are / were the -r xxxx numbers you had tagged as a stable release for each of the four packages, wpsr, wsprx, wsjt, wsjtx. I merely used the WSJT site to get the numbers:
For Example, WSPR-X v0.8 r3058:
svn co&#160;<A HREF="svn://svn.berlios.de/wsjt/branches/wsprx">svn://svn.berlios.de/wsjt/branches/wsprx</A> -r 3058

to see check-in-comments
svn log <A HREF="svn://svn.berlios.de/wsjt/branches/wsprx">svn://svn.berlios.de/wsjt/branches/wsprx</A> | less &#160;or &gt;&gt; wspr-x_change-log.txt for offline viewing

I think it's understood by most, that a shift from Python to Qt is underway. From an end-user / package maintainer perspective (not dev), this just means we need different deps and the build process is a bit different depending on which package we're building, testing or using for real QSO's.
---------------------
-- Joe, K1JT Wrote
I hope that development of WSJT-X will soon reach a stable point 

(perhaps to be called version 1.0 ?) at which a formal release with 
smoothly functioning JT9 will make sense.  At that stage we should 
certainly make available a snapshot tarfile of the source, as well as 
binary installation packages for Windows, Debian-based linux, and 
possibly OS-X and other *nix distributions. 

---------------------
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> KI7MT: I think the packaging burden, for the many different distro's could be offloaded to the relevant package maintainers or ppa providers if they knew; 1-what language(s) were used (Python, Qt, etc, which is pretty obvious, but still needed), 2-what the release -r xxxx numbers are, 3-what if any build specific requirements has changed since the last stable release.  From that point, the package builders can go off and do their thing for their respective distro.
</I>I think providing change-logs and -r xxxx of tagged Stable Release's could go a long way toward devising a process to package for the many different distro's, no matter which modes are contained within the particular base application.

---------------------

-- Joe, K1JT Wrote
I would welcome comments from others on the best development procedures, 
going forward. -- Joe, K1JT
