<PRE>Hi Joe, All,

For WSJT-X

1. The biggest thing I'm seeing on the boards is rig-control&#160;anomalies, which it looks like you all are working on.

2. The last few days, there's been a series of posts&#160;regarding&#160;crashes or uninitiated shut downs of the program. I've seen these myself, but I have no explanation for it, nor how and why it's happening. I've tried to reproduce it, but can't, as it seems random.

3. Allot of the bugs being reported seem to be around the JT-Alert-X integration, rather than the WSJT-X&#160;application&#160;itself.

With the inclusion of JT-Alerts-X, I've seen a sizable increase in&#160;usage&#160;of WSJT-X. Stats from pskreporter statistics:


<A HREF="http://pskreporter.info/cgi-bin/pskstats.pl">http://pskreporter.info/cgi-bin/pskstats.pl</A>


This is just a 2hr snapshot, but have seen it well over 5000+ in peak times during the day.

4. If we're adding wish list stuff, a bug list of some kind would be helpful, for all the relevant branch apps. I'm sure the community could / would help triage and confirm them if they knew what they were or how to try and replicate them. As it stands now, for most of us, we only know the problems being posted on WSJT-Group.

5. A&#160;feature&#160;request list or something to separate bugs from wishlist items. and some sort of roadmap of what's going to be included and when so people like me stop bugging the developers with&#160;questions&#160;:-)

73's Greg, KI7MT
