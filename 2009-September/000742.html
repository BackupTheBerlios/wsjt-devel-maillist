Yes.  As far as I know, this has been true since revision r1316.

&gt;<i> I was glad to see the new modes in WSJT8A branch. I see new mode JTMS.

</I>&gt;<i> Plese, Joe, can you say a few words for the new modes?
</I>
The WSJT8A branch is 100% experimental at this time.  It presently has 
bare-bones implementations of four digital modes: JTMS (designed to 
replace FSK441), ISCAT (to replace JT6M), JT64 (to replace JT65), and 
JT8 (to replace JT65A at HF).  Some potential advantages of these modes 
over their predecessors are outlined in the text file compare_modes.txt 
and other *.txt files in the WSJT8A branch.

Warning: all of these notes were prepared primarily for my own use, at 
this point.  You may find some of the notes rather cryptic.

Of course anyone is welcome to browse the code and the several text 
files, and to offer suggestions.  I must warn you again, though, that 
everything here is experimental.  Decoders for the various modes are in 
my simulator, but have not yet been moved into the WSJT8A directory. 
You can compile the program, probably, but you can't make QSOs with it. 
  *Lots* of additional work, including on-the-air tests, remains to be 
done if the new features of WSJT8 ever become ready for release.

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
