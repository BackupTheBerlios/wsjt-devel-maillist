Thanks for the info, some comments below.

Not necessarily, I assume the proportions that build their own is very 
small so whatever works for them might be valid answer here.

&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In practice, we have come up to speed individually and found things 
</I>&gt;<i> that work.  No doubt better organization could be arranged.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Up to now, released versions have been built using Qt 4.7.4.  We have 
</I>&gt;<i> been planning to move to Qt5 -- and as far as I'm concerned, we could 
</I>&gt;<i> do that now.  (I asked about this and a number of other organizational 
</I>&gt;<i> matters in an email on July 19, but have not had much response yet.)
</I>
I notice that the current Qt5 release for Windoze Mingw includes a Mingw 
4.8 toolchain which can't be official since the Mingw.org site only goes 
up to 4.7. This is one of the reasons I asked. Having said that it isn't 
much use as gfortran isn't included so a unified build with that isn't 
possible without hacking on the toolchain.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> What compiler versions are used to build the current Windows binary
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> release?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My Windows builds have been done under MinGW using these tools:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; g95 --version
</I>&gt;<i> G95 (GCC 4.1.2 (g95 0.92!) Jun 17 2009)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; g++ --version
</I>&gt;<i> g++ (GCC) 4.4.0
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; make --version
</I>&gt;<i> GNU Make 3.81
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; qmake --version
</I>&gt;<i> QMake version 2.01a
</I>&gt;<i> Using Qt version 4.7.4 in C:\QtSDK\Desktop\Qt\4.7.4\mingw\lib
</I>
When I was looking into the comms issues recently, I built with tools in 
the Cygwin environment. They have a Mingw package with g++ &amp; gfortran at 
4.7 and that seemed ok with Qt 5.1.0.

I did have issues when running under gdb on Windows, the wsjtx exe 
failed to exit cleanly. It SEGV'ed before the settings could be saved 
which was annoying. I didn't manage to find the cause of this. The same 
exe seemed Ok outside of gdb. This might be a toolchain version issue or 
simply an issue with the source itself.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Advice?  Recommendations?
</I>
I guess the only thing that matters is if someone who has to build (for 
some obscure platform for example) is restricted to an older version of 
something in the toolchain.

Perhaps those who make binary packages for other than Windows can 
comment on what they use?

Personally, with my C++ programmer hat on, I would prefer g++ &gt;= 4.7 as 
the current ISO Standard support is weaker before that.

My FORTRAN programmers hat was lost and forgotten many years ago (think 
punched card decks passed to operators through a hatch in return for 
dead trees some time later if there weren't any compiler errors).
