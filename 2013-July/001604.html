suppose a checkin is the best way to get the other platforms tested.

</I>I'm already working on SoundOutThread but it's more difficult to grok 
because there's lots of coupling with the main window code.

I have a further small modification for SoundInput that should be a 
little safer on the context shared variables. I haven't gone for full 
safety as I don't think the latency impact is warranted as the worst 
problem would seem to be a remote chance of a missed chunk of samples in 
the waterfall.
