<PRE>Hi Joe and Others

OK, I'm on it.   Thinking about this: Is it always the case that you'd 
want JT9 2kHz above the JT65 frequency?  What if you needed an extra 
500Hz on the base frequency to work split say?    What if you wanted a 
frequency for split that was different to JT65?  That would require 3 
frequencies per band but if we're going to alter the layout of that page 
(the setup page), might as well try to make it work as well as we can.

Sounds like it'll need to be 4 column table (4th column for antenna 
description) which I'm guessing will need to be in a scrolled window to 
cover all the bands.

If the table is already filled out with the default frequencies it 
shouldn't be too daunting.  Or perhaps your idea would be better - less 
versatile but perhaps more accessible to the user.

I'll think on it some more..
Cheers

&gt;<i> Murray -- many thanks for your offer.  By all means, take on the task 
</I>&gt;<i> of implementing Edson's idea of having an &quot;Antenna info&quot; entry for 
</I>&gt;<i> each band on the &quot;Default Frequancies&quot; tab.  At the same time, here's 
</I>&gt;<i> another idea for that tab: suppose we change all the default 
</I>&gt;<i> frequencies to the nominal JT65 valuse, and add a checkbox next to 
</I>&gt;<i> each one.  The meaning of the checkbox is &quot;add 2 kHz when running in 
</I>&gt;<i> JT9-only mode&quot;.  Does this make sense?
</I>
