No and No... but perhaps there should be.

I would be happy to hear advice and recommendations from anyone who 
knows more about such organizational matters than I do.

For the record: I'm not really a programmer -- just a physicist who 
knows how to program (sort of).  There are real programmers here who 
certainly know more than I about these things.

In practice, we have come up to speed individually and found things that 
work.  No doubt better organization could be arranged.

Up to now, released versions have been built using Qt 4.7.4.  We have 
been planning to move to Qt5 -- and as far as I'm concerned, we could do 
that now.  (I asked about this and a number of other organizational 
matters in an email on July 19, but have not had much response yet.)

&gt;<i> What compiler versions are used to build the current Windows binary
</I>&gt;<i> release?
</I>
My Windows builds have been done under MinGW using these tools:

 &gt; g95 --version
G95 (GCC 4.1.2 (g95 0.92!) Jun 17 2009)

 &gt; g++ --version
g++ (GCC) 4.4.0

 &gt; make --version
GNU Make 3.81

 &gt; qmake --version
QMake version 2.01a
Using Qt version 4.7.4 in C:\QtSDK\Desktop\Qt\4.7.4\mingw\lib

Advice?  Recommendations?

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
