I was looking at the Qt 5.1 docs and the QAudioInput class is not 
described in the Audio overview, nor is it listed in the module class 
list. I suppose the docs are still a work in progress. Having found it 
by looking up in the full list of classes; yes it does seem to fit the 
requirement well.
