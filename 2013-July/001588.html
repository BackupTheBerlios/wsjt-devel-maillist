Yes, you are right. It was the idea behind  portaudio too.

&gt;<i> I understand the idea behind pulseaudio as a sound server. However, I
</I>&gt;<i> had some bad experience with it in the past while trying to use it with
</I>&gt;<i> fldigi and with SDR software. It added unnecessary latency, complexity

</I>
Early releases of pulseaudio have made many problems. pulseaudio is a 
piece of software that has been released at a too early state. Myself, I 
have never seen problems when using pulseaudio with fldigi. Of course, 
the latency is lower if we use less software between the application 
program and the hardware. But the complexity of the user interface 
increases. I my own opinion, the pulseaudio interface to the classical 
application is rather simple. At this level we are considering audio 
streams and not more sound cards.

&gt;<i> Also, there is the
</I>&gt;<i> risk of some application injecting undesirable audio samples on a stream
</I>&gt;<i> that is being transmitted.
</I>
This risk exists also when using the ALSA interface on pulseaudio. This 
is the classical case when using portaudio on a modern Linux 
distribution based on pulseaudio. Requesting to stop pulseaudio in order 
to be able to run a specific application would not be a real practical 
solution.

&gt;<i> As far as I know, pulseaudio is (was) _*not*_
</I>&gt;<i> designed for real-time audio. This is fine for using the computer to
</I>&gt;<i> play music, but undesirable for low latency audio applications. Jackd
</I>&gt;<i> shines in this respect.
</I>
As far as I know, pulseaudio was designed to be the standard sound 
system on modern Linux systems. This the the case here, on Fedora. Jackd 
was designed for another environment. There exists a jackd interface to 
pulseaudio. I have never seen a classical Linux distribution based on 
the native jackd.

I'm using fldigi on pulseaudio without problems. I have used wsjt using 
portaudio -&gt; ALSA -&gt; pulseaudio without problems. I have used wsjtx in 
the same manner. pulseaudio's problem is the limited documentation 
available and the lack of really useful error messages in the software. 
The software we are speaking about here is not really critical at this 
level, as I known.
