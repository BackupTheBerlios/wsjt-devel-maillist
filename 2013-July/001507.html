<PRE>Hi Joe

My username at Berlios is VK3ACF and I've just subscribed to the 
wsjt-svn list.

Yes, I think having a stable and beta release is a good idea.  By all 
means wait until after the release of 1.1. In the mean time I might look 
at some basic input validation on those fields.  I still can't find any 
string length restriction for PSK Reporter's antenna description field 
other than the datagram format he's using has a data field length limit 
of 254 bytes. Thats quite some description!  I might just make it some 
arbitrary but realistic length, say 64 characters.

Cheers
Murray

</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for the update!  I will look forward to trying your code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now, you won't be able to do an &quot;svn commit&quot; with your code 
</I>&gt;<i> changes.  I'll be happy to add you to the list of &quot;developers&quot; with 
</I>&gt;<i> write permission to the SVN repository.  Are you already subscribed to 
</I>&gt;<i> the mailing lists WSJT-SVN and WSJT-devel ?  You will need to register 
</I>&gt;<i> on the Berlios site with a unix username (e.g., your callsign, or 
</I>&gt;<i> whatever you want to use).  Then let me know your login name, and I 
</I>&gt;<i> can add you to the list of WSJT developers.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> No doubt you will have gathered that a release of &quot;Version 1.1&quot; is 
</I>&gt;<i> imminent.  I suggest that we add your code to the SVN tree just after 
</I>&gt;<i> that release.  Yours can then be one of the first feature additions in 
</I>&gt;<i> a line of continuing development -- v1.1.1, or v1.2, or whatever. 
</I>&gt;<i> Probably I should start posting on the WSJT web site both a &quot;stable&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> release and (when appropriate) a later, beta-level release.  The betas 
</I>&gt;<i> can be promoted to &quot;stable&quot; status when they've been used and 
</I>&gt;<i> validated for some appropriate time.  Does this make sense to you?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Let's move any further communication about yout proposed changes to 
</I>&gt;<i> the wsjt-devel reflector, so that everyone else will know what's up.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have a 3 column implementation working based on r3484 which I think
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> addresses the multiple antenna request. It may be a little cumbersome
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for those who work many bands with the same antenna but its easy enough
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to copy and paste between bands and they only need to do it once.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Changes are:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * The third tab of the DevSetup window I've labelled &quot;Band Settings&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (was &quot;Default frequencies&quot;)
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * This tab now contains a scrolled window with 3 columns: band
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> description, frequency and antenna description.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * These are all QLineEdit to allow each to be edited.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * The band combo box on the main window is now populated from the band
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> descriptions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * PSKReporter gets its antenna description from the appropriate band.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * The three columns (of 16 rows) are read/written to the ini file.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> * The original PSKAntenna entry has been removed from the first tab
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I renamed the frequencies in the ini file to force a default frequencies
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> update for those with an existing ini file. That may or may not be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good idea!
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Things yet to do:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The band combo box could be usefully made a little wider to allow for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the any extra text at some stage. I've left it for the moment.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I've not put any input validation on the entered text - couldn't find
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> any reference to text string limits for PSK Reporter. I notice too that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> theres no validation on the frequency input either.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Perhaps I should put a checkbox somewhere: Use same antenna for all,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> either with another QLineEdit for the default or perhaps just use the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> first band's entry.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The number of bands is currently hard coded at 16. These could usefully
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be converted to dynamic lists with a 'Add' button at the bottom of the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Band Settings tab for those power users who may want more than 16 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> entries.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I can email the changed files to you for review, or push them to the SVN
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> repository - whatever suits.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
