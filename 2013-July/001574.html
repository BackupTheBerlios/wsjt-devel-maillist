<PRE>Hi Bill and all,

</I>
I'll list several reasons that I did it this way, without trying to 
assign relative weights.

1. When developing the decoder algorithms it was handy to compile them 
as stand-alone programs.  They can be run from the command line with 
*.wav files as input, or as a sub-process invoked by the GUI parts of 
MAP65, WSPR-X, or WSJT-X, with raw data and decoder parameters in a 
shared memory block.

2. Alternatively, the decoder could be compiled as part of a single 
executable and executed in a separate thread.  This could be a perfectly 
reasonable approach, and indeed is the one taken in the Python-GUI 
programs WSPR, WSJT, and the original MAP65.  Having already tried that 
method, I wanted to try the other one.  For me, much of this effort is 
about learning.

3. Decoding speed is indeed important, but experimentally I determined 
that the added cost of shared memory synchronization contributes 
negligibly to decode times.

4. I have zero training and zero experience doing any of these things, 
and I don't necessarily know the best procedures.  MAP65, WSPR-X, and 
WSJT-X are the only programs I've ever written that use C++ or Qt.  No 
real experience with multi-threading, either, except for that gained 
with the older WSJT-related programs.

I'm happy to learn, and to change, when shown that there are better ways 
of doing things.

&gt;<i> I understand the complications of fortran common or module data with
</I>&gt;<i> threads but as I see it, at the moment at least, there is a one to one
</I>&gt;<i> relationship of decoders to GUI programs.
</I>
Not sure I understand what's meant or implied by your one to one 
relationship ...  In WSJT-X we have one GUI program and one decoding 
process, but of course the latter has two decoders (JT9 and JT65).

&gt;<i> The sound input processing looks distinctly thread unsafe to me with
</I>&gt;<i> unguarded (not even volatile for what it's worth) variables being used
</I>&gt;<i> for inter-thread signalling. Is this a known issue?
</I>
Although arguably &quot;it ain't broke&quot;, so doesn;t need fixing, this might 
be considered another good reason to rewrite the audio I/O using tools 
in the QAudio class.
