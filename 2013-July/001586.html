</I>That wasn't what I was suggesting in my post above. Mutexes will block 
and are unsuitable for low latency processing as in the streaming callback.

I would replace the use of bare bool/int to communicate between user 
threads and interrupt level with atomic variables Qt (5 at least) 
provides QAtomic... objects which are a fairly easy replacement if the 
right memory mode is selected.

Also because the sampling thread doesn't run an event loop (no call to 
exec() in the run method) it cannot process Qt events or Qt slots in the 
thread. This means that care must be taken to synchronize member 
function calls that communicate with the run() method since they run in 
the GUI thread.

If the Qt5 switch is certain for the next release, I can try and code a 
version of SoundInThread that I think will be safer and still low latency.

Alternatively SoundInThread could be refactored to the &quot;Qt way&quot; running 
a local event loop in its thread and using an asynchronous timer to 
schedule processing (it currently uses a blocking sleep). That way I 
think it could asynchronously respond to signals in a thread safe way.
