<PRE>Hi Claude,

I think is will be worthwhile trying pulseaudio then. I will let pulseaudio
grab the sound card I use for wsjt-x and see how things go.

</I>&gt;<i>      The idea behind pulseaudio is to liberate the application from the

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     streams from the pulseaudio server. The selection of devices, the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     mixer, the volume control are now a matter which pulseaudio has to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     manage. There are tools available to the user. pulseaudio is now the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>     standard sound system of most modern Linux distributions.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I thought that was the purpose for ALSA! ;-)

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, you are right. It was the idea behind  portaudio too.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I understand the idea behind pulseaudio as a sound server. However, I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> had some bad experience with it in the past while trying to use it with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fldigi and with SDR software. It added unnecessary latency, complexity
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> and, at the time, it did not work well with jackd.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Early releases of pulseaudio have made many problems. pulseaudio is a
</I>&gt;<i> piece of software that has been released at a too early state. Myself, I
</I>&gt;<i> have never seen problems when using pulseaudio with fldigi. Of course, the
</I>&gt;<i> latency is lower if we use less software between the application program
</I>&gt;<i> and the hardware. But the complexity of the user interface increases. I my
</I>&gt;<i> own opinion, the pulseaudio interface to the classical application is
</I>&gt;<i> rather simple. At this level we are considering audio streams and not more
</I>&gt;<i> sound cards.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  Also, there is the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> risk of some application injecting undesirable audio samples on a stream
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that is being transmitted.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This risk exists also when using the ALSA interface on pulseaudio. This is
</I>&gt;<i> the classical case when using portaudio on a modern Linux distribution
</I>&gt;<i> based on pulseaudio. Requesting to stop pulseaudio in order to be able to
</I>&gt;<i> run a specific application would not be a real practical solution.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  As far as I know, pulseaudio is (was) _*not*_
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> designed for real-time audio. This is fine for using the computer to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> play music, but undesirable for low latency audio applications. Jackd
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shines in this respect.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As far as I know, pulseaudio was designed to be the standard sound system
</I>&gt;<i> on modern Linux systems. This the the case here, on Fedora. Jackd was
</I>&gt;<i> designed for another environment. There exists a jackd interface to
</I>&gt;<i> pulseaudio. I have never seen a classical Linux distribution based on the
</I>&gt;<i> native jackd.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm using fldigi on pulseaudio without problems. I have used wsjt using
</I>&gt;<i> portaudio -&gt; ALSA -&gt; pulseaudio without problems. I have used wsjtx in the
</I>&gt;<i> same manner. pulseaudio's problem is the limited documentation available
</I>&gt;<i> and the lack of really useful error messages in the software. The software
</I>&gt;<i> we are speaking about here is not really critical at this level, as I known.
