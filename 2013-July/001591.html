Unfortunately not so. The streaming callback is called from some other 
context like a signal handler or a thread within the audio package. It 
has to access the same buffer as wsjtx itself needs.

I am currently hacking on soundin to make a single threaded version. I 
will post a patch if it works and those who are interested could test it 
on some different architectures and o/s'es.

</I>
I've only looked at QAudioInput in detail, there's no need for threads 
if the &quot;push&quot; model of operation is used (just like the &quot;push&quot; model 
wsjt-x currently uses with portaudio). The class emits a signal when a 
period of samples is available. There is no blocking or lengthy 
processing unless the &quot;pull&quot; model is used which uses read() calls to 
get data.

</I>&gt;<i> Joe, what do you think restoring the recording to a wave file instead 
</I>&gt;<i> of shared memory? Since the longer JT9 modes have been retired, the 
</I>&gt;<i> size of the file should not be too large. This could, in principle, 
</I>&gt;<i> simplify the audio handling and testing.
