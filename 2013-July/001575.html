</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll list several reasons that I did it this way, without trying to 
</I>&gt;<i> assign relative weights.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. When developing the decoder algorithms it was handy to compile them 
</I>&gt;<i> as stand-alone programs.  They can be run from the command line with 
</I>&gt;<i> *.wav files as input, or as a sub-process invoked by the GUI parts of 
</I>&gt;<i> MAP65, WSPR-X, or WSJT-X, with raw data and decoder parameters in a 
</I>&gt;<i> shared memory block.
</I>OK, but this is not a good reason. For example the JT9(JT65) decoder is 
already wrapped several times over and a decoder library of functions 
could easily be given an interface that could be used in both GUI and 
stand alone varieties. There would be a little complexity in providing 
results during the decoding process(es) via a callback mechanism rather 
than writing to an output stream. Once such a mechanism is designed it 
would be pretty easy to write a file reading wrapper, a GUI, or even a 
background service type decoder.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Alternatively, the decoder could be compiled as part of a single 
</I>&gt;<i> executable and executed in a separate thread.  This could be a 
</I>&gt;<i> perfectly reasonable approach, and indeed is the one taken in the 
</I>&gt;<i> Python-GUI programs WSPR, WSJT, and the original MAP65. Having already 
</I>&gt;<i> tried that method, I wanted to try the other one. For me, much of this 
</I>&gt;<i> effort is about learning.
</I>OK learning is a valid reason, as is doing things in a way you are 
comfortable with when you have other priorities. OK on the other 
programs in the suite, I haven't looked at them yet but intend to. For a 
while I have thought the different modes have a quite different internal 
implementation, here I don't mean the decoder so much as all the 
ancillary parts like CAT, waterfall displays, UI etc.. It might be 
better to build a library of decoders, displays and services that could 
be reused both in different modes and different programs (GUI, batch, 
background, external applications, ...).
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Decoding speed is indeed important, but experimentally I determined 
</I>&gt;<i> that the added cost of shared memory synchronization contributes 
</I>&gt;<i> negligibly to decode times.
</I>Ok, I agree the cost is small given the time available ~10s but the 
complexity added might be expensive later on in terms of the rigidity of 
the interface.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. I have zero training and zero experience doing any of these things, 
</I>&gt;<i> and I don't necessarily know the best procedures.  MAP65, WSPR-X, and 
</I>&gt;<i> WSJT-X are the only programs I've ever written that use C++ or Qt.  No 
</I>&gt;<i> real experience with multi-threading, either, except for that gained 
</I>&gt;<i> with the older WSJT-related programs.
</I>Again a very good reason, C++ and GUI development must have been a steep 
learning curve when also developing and optimising the decoder 
algorithms at the same time. Quite a daunting undertaking and you have 
done really well.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm happy to learn, and to change, when shown that there are better 
</I>&gt;<i> ways of doing things.
</I>This is the main reason for my questions. I would like to contribute and 
as a professional software engineer I think my most helpful 
contributions might be in refactoring some of the structural design to 
reflect best practice. It would be great as a user with s/w development 
experience to be able to contribute to this project since I feel it will 
be very successful. I doubt if I could contribute much to the math and 
DSP side even though I have worked on embedded audio and video 
applications :(
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I understand the complications of fortran common or module data with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> threads but as I see it, at the moment at least, there is a one to one
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> relationship of decoders to GUI programs.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure I understand what's meant or implied by your one to one 
</I>&gt;<i> relationship ...  In WSJT-X we have one GUI program and one decoding 
</I>&gt;<i> process, but of course the latter has two decoders (JT9 and JT65).
</I>What I meant was that if you were, for example, to call two decoder 
procedures in two concurrent threads (I'm perhaps thinking JT9 and JT65 
for example) in an attempt to divide and conquer the workload; then the 
common block data would be shared by both function calls. Whereas two 
separate processes would have different address spaces and hence local 
copies of the common data. The former is a thread safety nightmare!
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The sound input processing looks distinctly thread unsafe to me with
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> unguarded (not even volatile for what it's worth) variables being used
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> for inter-thread signalling. Is this a known issue?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Although arguably &quot;it ain't broke&quot;, so doesn;t need fixing, this might 
</I>&gt;<i> be considered another good reason to rewrite the audio I/O using tools 
</I>&gt;<i> in the QAudio class.
</I>The &quot;It ain't broke&quot; approach has bee proven broken for concurrency in 
software. It is so hard to test that it's working as expected. The only 
proven approach is to code defensively and very carefully.

Here's a common example:
++++++
Many programmers assume a boolean variable or integer word can be used 
to signal between threads of control (threads or interrupt handlers for 
example). They assume word changes are atomic and cannot be &quot;torn&quot; by 
context switches and therefore &quot;what can go wrong?&quot;.

Some programmers make the boolean variable &quot;volatile&quot; (a C/C++ keyword 
that &quot;hints&quot; to the compiler that the variable must be read from memory 
every time it is needed and written to memory as soon as it is changed) 
and assume that is sufficient. These programmers throw scorn at the one 
who don't use &quot;volatile&quot; because they know that the compiler may cache 
the variable in different registers in each thread and it won't work as 
intended.

A smaller group of programmers know that &quot;volatile&quot; is only a hint to 
the compiler so they use thread synchronisation primitives for inter 
thread signalling like counting semaphores, mutexes and, condition 
variables. These programmers throw scorn at the programmers that use 
&quot;volatile&quot; variables because they also know that on multi-core systems 
even if the compiler does the right thing, the hardware will defeat it 
by allowing each thread to have a memory cache which might have 
different representations of the same variable!! BTW this group 
sometimes bring out the secondary argument that processors can reorder 
instructions in the pipeline which can break the assumptions even when 
&quot;volatile&quot; is honoured by the compiler.

An even smaller group of programmers realise that all those thread 
synchronisation primitives are very expensive to use and impact the very 
latency that threading is used to combat so they get the compiler 
writers to fix their memory model so they can implement lock free atomic 
operations on simple variables that use &quot;memory barriers&quot; that ensure 
all caches are in sync at a known point in the process. These 
programmers don't scorn the ones that use thread synchronization 
primitives because they know that using them correctly is hard enough 
already and bringing out the lock free atomics for ultimate concurrency 
is not a task taken on lightly. But they do know that using the thread 
synchronisation primitives is often done badly with results like 
deadlocks, livelocks and, race conditions leading to unexplained lockups 
and corrupted data. The best of this group also try to use asynchronous 
techniques wherever possible as that can be done in a single thread 
letting the o/s deal with the concurrency issues which is what it does best.
+++++++

Threads are difficult and should only be used when absolutely necessary, 
and then only very carefully.


I had a quick look at the Qt multimedia library and I'm not sure it fits 
the required model very well. I see a way of recording audio to a file 
(QAudioRecorder) and a way of probing the samples as they are recorded 
(QAudioProbe). These might work within a framework that records each 
period to a file with QAudioRecorder and uses QAudioProbe to collect the 
samples for FFT and eventual decoding. Alternatively I suppose that 
QAudioRecorder might be usable by recording continuously to a null 
device and QAudioProbe used to extract the samples soon after they are 
captured. Overall I'm not so sure that the Qt audio classes are really 
designed to work at the level and latency required, but I'm not a Qt 
expert and definitely not a Qt multimedia expert so there may be a 
better way.

I am currently implementing a few ideas in a test framework to try and 
develop a framework for WS type programs. I am looking a cleaner cross 
platform building, better GUI state handling, better fortran integration 
and, use of modern C++ programming techniques. I will try and plug in 
existing functionality as I go along to see how I can minimize the 
disruptive effect of any structural changes I propose.

Expect more questions along these lines as I dig deeper into the 
functionality.
