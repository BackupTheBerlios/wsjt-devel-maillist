<PRE>Hi Sven,

Thanks for your message.  After scratching my head a bit more, I've come 
to the conclusion that the effect I'm observing is probably the one 
described here:

<A HREF="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/restoring-geometry.html">http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/restoring-geometry.html</A>

It's not enough of an issue for me to do anything about it, right now.
