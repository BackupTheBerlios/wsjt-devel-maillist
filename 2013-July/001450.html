<PRE>To:   Users and potential users of WSJT-X
From: Joe Taylor, K1JT

I invite you to test-drive version 1.1 of WSJT-X.  This version of the 
program is &quot;bi-lingual&quot; -- it transmits and receives both JT9 and JT65 
signals, switching between modes automatically as needed.  The maximum 
displayed bandwidth has been increased from 1 to 5 kHz.  If your 
receiver has an upper-sideband filter at least 4 kHz wide, on most bands 
you can have all the JT65 *and* all the JT9 activity on screen at once, 
available for making QSOs.

Other improvements since v1.0, r3323 include the following:

1. CAT control via DxLab Commander.
2. Improved GUI appearance, especially on Linux and OS X.
3. Compilable with Qt5 as well as Qt4.
4. Fixed occasional program crashes caused by receiving a message in the
form &quot;call1 call2&quot; (with no grid, report, etc.).
5. Improved handling of audio device selection in Linux.
6. Log QSO frequency, instead of dial frequency only.
7. Added Tx Power to ADIF log information, with option to retain between 
QSOs.
8. Added option to retain between QSOs the Power and Comments fields for 
ADIF and wsjtx logs.
9. Added optional antenna description for PSK Reporter.
10 Fixed a bug in handling of logged grid locator when none was 
available on the double-clicked line.
11. Fixed a bug that caused small differences in the lengths of 
transmitted symbols.
12. Tx message (highlighted in yellow) now includes a mode flag and the 
audio frequency.
13. Added a spinner control for Rx Freq.
14. New on-screen button &quot;Lock Tx=Rx&quot; locks Tx and Rx frequencies together.
15. Allow COM port number greater than 9 (Windows only).
16. Don't clear DxGrid when user double-clicks on a message with no 
grid, if the message's Tx call is same as DxCall.
17. Double-click on yellow Tx message sets frequency, but does nothing else.
18. Rationalized the logic of the CAT control indicator button. Now 
colored grey/green/orange/red -- see User's Guide.


Even if you are already familiar with version 1.0, you should first read 
the new online WSJT-X User's Guide:
<A HREF="http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT-X_Users_Guide_v1.1.pdf">http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT-X_Users_Guide_v1.1.pdf</A>

You can download the Windows installation package from
<A HREF="http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJTX_110r3459.exe">http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJTX_110r3459.exe</A>

The program also runs well under Linux and OS X, but presently on these 
platforms you must compile it yourself.

In many ways this release has been &quot;cleaned up&quot; and is more mature than 
version 1.0.  But with the JT65 capabilities it also contains a lot of 
new code.  Please send us bug reports and any suggestions for improvement.

A new version of JT-Alert (by VK3AMA) is in the works.  At present your 
JT9 activity will be handled as before -- but not your JT65 activity 
with WSJT-X.

Finally: This is a group effort.  My warmest thanks to AC6SL, G4KLA, 
PY2SDR, and VK4BDJ (members of the WSJT Development Team), and to DJ0OT, 
G4ILO, K0KC, K3WYC, NH7SR, W4TV, and VK3ACF, who been testing various 
alpha versions of WSJT-X v1.1.  Your input is greatly appreciated!

     -- 73, Joe, K1JT

lists, for example the JT65_HF Yahoo group, please feel free to do so.
