<PRE>Hi All

I've just committed revision 3498.  The third tab on the setup window is 
now called band settings and has a scrolling list of band entries. The 
left column is the text visible on the main window where you select the 
band.  I've not put a limit on the length of text you may enter here but 
you'll only get to see the last 8 characters or so.

Each band entry has its own frequency as before and now has its own 
antenna description that is sent to PSK reporter when so enabled.

On the main window I've moved the 'readFreq' button down beside a 
slightly shortened &quot;+2 kHz&quot; button.

The entry for the default frequencies has a new name in the ini file - 
you'll notice all the band frequencies will be set back to their 
defaults when you first run this version.

I don't have a suitable Windows environment for testing but the only 
Windows specific code is the string passed to the PSK reporter 
interface.  Should be fine but please let me know if thats not the case.

Thanks to Edson PY2SDR we now have antenna descriptions sent to PSK 
reporter from Linux. I've not been able to test that until tonight; 20M 
has been dead the last few days.

Any feedback welcome.  Joe and I had a bit of discussion about how to 
make multiple antennas work but I'm sure there will be improvements or 
alternatives to this current system.

Cheers
