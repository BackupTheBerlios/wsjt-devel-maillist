<PRE>Hi all,

WSJT-X r3496 has been released as Version 1.1.  I posted the Windows 
installation package, updated User's Guide, ChangeLog, and r3496 tarball 
on the WSJT web site.

The top of the ChangeLog reads as follows:

July 19, 2013: Version 1.1, r3496
---------------------------------
This is a full release of WSJT-X Version 1.1.  It provides an easy way
to make QSOs in both JT65 and JT9 modes.

Changes from the most recent beta release, r3487, include the
following:

1. Significant optimizations of the JT9 decoder, providing speed
improvements up to 5 times.

2. Frequency-setting through DX Lab Commander now works properly at
non-integral kHz frequencies.

3. A new meter widget has been added (thanks to PY2SDR).

4. Implementation of &quot;multiple instances&quot; has been completed and
tested (thanks to KK1D).

5. Several minor bug fixes.

I'll post installation packages (or links to them) for Linux and OS X as 
soon as they are available.


This is a good time to review progress and project goals.  When we 
released Version 1.0 I listed the following plans and &quot;desirables&quot; for 
future development effort:
                                                             Done ?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
   - Eliminate dependence on Qwt                              YES
   - Move from Qt4 to Qt5                                    CAN DO
   - Add rig control through DxLab Commander                  YES
   - Migrate from PortAudio to Qt's built-in QAudio handlers  NO
   - Add other WSJT modes: JT65, FSK441, ISCAT, JT4 ...      JT65
   - Support for I/Q transceivers such as SoftRock            NO
   - Expanded frequency range, perhaps 5 kHz or so.           YES
   - HowTo guides for compiling WSJT-X in Windows/MinGW,
     Linux, OS X, ...                                         NO
   - Binary installation packages for Linux and OS X          YES/NO

(We could move from Qt4 to Qt5 at any time, and I think we're close to 
being ready with an installation package for OS X.)

All in all, this is excellent progress in the past six weeks!  In a 
number of cases we've done even more than we had in mind when writing 
this list.  Many thanks and a hearty &quot;Well Done!&quot; to everyone who has 
contributed!

So what next?  It seems to me that the more important identified tasks 
include these:

   - Add code written by Murray, VK3ACF, for band-by-band antenna info
   - Move from Qt4 to Qt5
   - Migrate from PortAudio to Qt's built-in QAudio handlers
   - Support for I/Q transceivers such as SoftRock
   - Add more WSJT modes: JT4, ISCAT, FSK441
   - HowTo guides for compiling WSJT-X

Inevitably we'll also have some bug reports to address... and there are 
always rig-control issues for particular radios that don't quite work 
right.  What have I forgotten?  What else should be added?

If you care to tackle one of these tasks, please let us know -- and use 
the wsjt-devel list to keep us abreast of your progress.

I checked this morning to be sure that r3496 of WSJT-X compiles OK under 
Qt5.  After changing one variable name all is well.
(The declaration
extern QTcpSocket* socket;
was changed changed to
extern QTcpSocket* rigSocket;
to avoid conflict with a definition in winsock.h)
Are we ready, then, to pull the plug permanently on Qt4?  One downside 
is that the Windows package built from Qt5 is around 15 MB, as opposed 
to 10.5 MB for Qt4.  (I guess such a tendency toward bloat is inevitable.)

Your opinions?  Other suggestions?

A few final thoughts, in passing:

Would it be helpful if we made a serious effort to put more time into 
reviewing one another's code changes and additions?

How best to encourage more people to switch from JT65 to JT9, and to use 
JT9 on more bands??

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
