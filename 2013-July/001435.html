</I>I use the window manager MATE and windows appear where they where
before. The only difference is when you start an application several
times. The one after will always offset the previous one by a certain
amount of pixels.
I reckon the idea originated when showing error messages. In MS Windows
an error message always appears at the same koordinates. Having, lets
say 8 of the same error message (which can happen) and trying to close
it, one would think it can't be closed (because it re-appears). But in
cases it only seems to re-appear because there are other ones below the
one you just closed.

In Linux, those messages appear offset by a certain amount of pixels, so
the user knows there are more than one and not just re-appearing.
With application where one doesn't have a taskbar, you see exactly how
many times it was started.

I hope this helps and makes sense?
