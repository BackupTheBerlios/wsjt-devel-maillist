Subject: WSJT-X v1.1 and Default frequencies for JT65 and JT9
Date: Fri, 12 Jul 2013 15:55:45 -0400
From: Joe Taylor &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/wsjt-devel">joe at princeton.edu</A>&gt;

Hi all,

Thanks for the input in response to my questions, both on this reflector
and off-list.

I've concluded that the best solutions for startup default frequencies
in WSJT-X are these:

Band  Dial Freq
  (m)    (MHz)
---------------
  160    1.838
   80    3.576
   60    5.357
   40    7.076
   30   10.138
   20   14.076
   17   18.102
   15   21.076
   12   24.917
   10   28.076
    6   50.276

With these dial frequency settings JT65 signals would be expected at
audio frequencies 270 to 2270 Hz, JT9 signals at 2500 to 4000 Hz.

For operators who cannot use the extended bandwidth capability of WSJT-X
v1.1, the program now has a checkbox labeled &quot;+ 2 kHz&quot;, just under the
band selector.  With that box checked, selecting 20 m will set your dial
frequency to 14.078 rather than 14.076, with no need to edit the default
frequency table.

I believe this scheme will work well on all bands except 30 m.  On that
band, with dial frequency 10.138 the 200 Hz &quot;WSPR band&quot; is from 2100 to
2300 Hz.  WSJT-X will now accommodate WSPR by refusing to transmit in
that band.  If you try to do so, the program will pop up this message:

&quot;Please choose another Tx frequency.
  WSJT-X will not knowingly transmit
  in the WSPR sub-band on 30 m.&quot;

Rather conveniently, with dial frequency 10.138 MHz the WSPR band is
located essentially between the JT65 and JT9 segments.

A full release of WSJT-X Version 1.1 will probably be made next week.
VK3AMA tells me that a compatible release of JT-Alert will be available
then, as well.

In the meantime, if you'd like to try the latest v1.1 beta release, a
Windows installation package for r3482 can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJTX_110r3482.exe">http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJTX_110r3482.exe</A>

Here's a quick list of differences between r3459 and r3482:

1. Operating in &quot;Split Tx&quot; mode is now optional (but of course is
required if you will transmit above 2.7 kHz).  See &quot;Split Tx&quot; checkbox
on the Configuration screen.

2. Correct TxMode label now appears on program startup.

3. &quot;Transmitting...&quot; message in ALL.TXT now has the correct TxMode.

4. File wsjt_status.txt includes the TxMode.

5. F4 clears Az, Dist, and the Tx1 through Tx5 message boxes.

6. You can decode JT9 signals in the JT65 frequency range, and
vice-versa, by double-clicking the signal in the waterfall.

7. Better logic for enabling/disabling the TestPTT button.

8. Do not call getFreq() when the TestPTT button is clicked and
PTTmethod is via CAT control.

9. New cold-start default frequencies, set at reasonable values for
JT65, and a &quot;+ 2 kHz&quot; checkbox.

10. A few default Tx macros, as examples.

11. Fixed several bugs in the interaction between WSJT-X and Commander,
especially for frequency settings below 10 MHz and above 100 MHz.

12. Display the correct UTC on decoded lines, when &quot;Shift+D&quot; has been
used to do another wideband decode during the following Rx sequence.

13. Correct a flaw in comparing Dial Frequency against a modified
default frequency setting.

14. The digital gain slider now affects waterfall signal levels.

15. Radio is no longer polled when blue &quot;Decode&quot; button is lit.  On a
few systems this was found to cause rig-communication problems.

16. Disallow split Tx operation through Ham Radio Deluxe -- it doesn't
seem to work.

17. Don't knowingly allow transmissions in the WSPR sub-band on 30 m.

18. Many updates to User's Guide.

As always, your thoughtful feedback on the beta release will be much
appreciated.
