<PRE>Hi Edson and all,

1. Yes, by all means go ahead with the plan to make your code for 
PSK-Reporter active on all platforms.  This will remove any dependence 
on Windows file PSKReporter.dll and its exported function names.

2. I am making the switch from Qt4 to Qt5 TODAY.  Henceforth I will be 
building under Qt5, in both Windows and Linux.

3. I think we're agreed that our next major task is to re-write 
soundin.cpp and soundout.cpp to use Qt's built-in QAudio tools instead 
of PortAudio.  Edson, are you willing to take on this task?  It need not 
have a short deadline, since we already have a solid system for audio I/O.

4. In parallel with #3, it would be good to straighten out any remaining 
issues with respect to rig control, GUI behavior, etc.  I would be happy 
to see input to this list about what's most important in this area, and 
volunteers to work in any capacity on pieces of it.

I will continue to think about the possibilities of adding support for 
I/Q transceivers such as SoftRock and adding other WSJT modes to WSJT-X. 
  Are there other important areas that we should be addressing?

What do others here think about my question of how best to encourage 
more people to switch from JT65 to JT9, and to use JT9 on more bands?

	-- Joe, K1JT
