<PRE>Hi again,

I'm now looking at the safety of variables shared with the portaudio 
context in soundin.cpp and have some questions.

The udata.ncalls variable and the related member m_SamFacIn appear to be 
redundant. Is this historical code than can be removed or is it 
something that may be used at a later date? If they are not redundant; 
the ncall item will overflow during long runs which may not be desirable.

The member m_dataSinkBusy is always false and the related member m_nBusy 
is always zero. I can see commented out code that would stop 
readyForFFT(n) signals being emitted, this would allow the FFT 
processing to skip if running too slowly if the signal/slot connect were 
the queued type. Is this another historical artefact or something that 
might be used again later? Changing to a single threaded audio input may 
have some bearing on this since signals from other threads are queued 
whereas intra-thread signals and normally executed by default.

There appears to be a race condition that might cause the index into the 
samples buffer sent to the FFT routine to be -1. I'm not sure if this a 
serious defect but if it is; reading the index before requesting a reset 
of the buffer might be wise. My Fortran isn't good enough to easily 
determine if symspec() copes with k=-1.
