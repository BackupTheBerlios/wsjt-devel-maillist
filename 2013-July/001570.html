<PRE>Hi,

I'm still familiarizing myself with the code base and have a couple of 
questions.

The decoding is done by a separate process. I think I know why but just 
in case I've missed some obvious reason why it can't be a simple fortran 
procedure call from C++ passing a pointer to a struct with the samples 
and callbacks to update the GUI, I thought I'd ask here?

I understand the complications of fortran common or module data with 
threads but as I see it, at the moment at least, there is a one to one 
relationship of decoders to GUI programs.

I ask because the decoding is time critical and the overhead and 
complexity of shared memory synchronization and lock files could be 
worth removing.

The sound input processing looks distinctly thread unsafe to me with 
unguarded (not even volatile for what it's worth) variables being used 
for inter-thread signalling. Is this a known issue?
