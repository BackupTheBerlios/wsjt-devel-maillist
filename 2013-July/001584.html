I thought that was the purpose for ALSA! ;-)

I understand the idea behind pulseaudio as a sound server. However, I had
some bad experience with it in the past while trying to use it with fldigi
and with SDR software. It added unnecessary latency, complexity and, at the
time, it did not work well with jackd. Also, there is the risk of some
application injecting undesirable audio samples on a stream that is being
transmitted. As far as I know, pulseaudio is (was) *not* designed for
real-time audio. This is fine for using the computer to play music, but
undesirable for low latency audio applications. Jackd shines in this
respect.

We could, of course, run some tests with recent pulseaudio releases and Qt5
and check if it is good enough for WSPR-X.
