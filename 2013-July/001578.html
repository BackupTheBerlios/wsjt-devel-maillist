Actually, I've found the documentation to be one of Qt's strongest 
features.

For QAudioInput and QAudioOutput go to

<A HREF="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtmultimedia/qaudioinput.html">http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtmultimedia/qaudioinput.html</A>
<A HREF="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtmultimedia/qaudiooutput.html">http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.1/qtmultimedia/qaudiooutput.html</A>

...

A few hours ago I quickly cobbled together drop-in replacements for 
soundin.h and soundin.cpp that use QAudioInput instead of PortAudio. 
The code compiled and ran without problems, and within an hour WSJT-X 
was decoding both JT65 and JT9 signals with the nes input routines.
The same approach for audio output should not be any more difficult.

I'm not suggesting that others should stop thinking about the best way 
to do these tasks... just reporting that a baseline system (the input 
device selection was temporarily hard-wired, for example) was easy to 
get going.
