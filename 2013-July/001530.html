<PRE>Hi John,

Thanks for your message -- it's very helpful.  See below for a couple of 
comments.

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes, that info can be added to the man page. But a pre-built

</I>
Agreed.  In the past we have found this to be a manageable 
inconvenience.  Compatibility with a current LTS version of Ubuntu seems 
to handle the most common installations.  Then we need OS X, too... 
When necessary, I've had others with an otherwise unsupported platform 
set up a login account for me.  I can compile kvasd on that host in a 
few minutes.

&gt;<i> Regarding the &quot;input volume level always zero when Pa_Initialize() is
</I>&gt;<i> called&quot;, after an &quot;apt-get dist-upgrade&quot;, that bad behavior stopped
</I>&gt;<i> happening, which makes me suspect that it is some file under /etc,
</I>&gt;<i> rather than some file under my user directory. Then, the bad behavior
</I>&gt;<i> returned, so I am still looking.
</I>
Weird!  Let us know when you have solved the problem.
