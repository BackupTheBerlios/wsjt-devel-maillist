<PRE>Hi Joe M,

Questions like yours are best addressed to the wsjt-devel list.
Your best source of information on compiling WSJT-X in OS X will be John 
Nelson, G4KLA.  No doubt John will respond when he finds time.

Changing the value of NSMAX is *NOT* a good idea.  Its size defines the 
maximum number of bins in spectra computed for the waterfall.

In \Linux it's easy to change the system default maximum size of a 
shared memory region.  You can just do this:

# echo &quot;8388608&quot; &gt; /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax

Or preferably, to preserve the new configuration after a reboot add the 
following to /etc/sysctl.conf

kernel.shmmax = 8388608

Calls to QSharedMemory::lock() are unnecessary since only the GUI writes 
to this region and synchronization is done in another way.  On the jt9 
side, jt9com is read-only.

The Fortran compiler decorates external symbols with a trailing 
underscore.  Thus to a C or C++ program, jt9com becomes jt9com_.

	-- Joe, K1JT

</I>&gt;<i> function that I've hit a system specific limitation. So I figured I needed to
</I>&gt;<i> try to shrink it (and later, figure out how to increase that number on the
</I>&gt;<i> MacOsX side). I noticed in your common.h on the Qt side of things that you

</I>&gt;<i> fortran and Qt sides of things, and I could get it to compile and link, but it
</I>&gt;<i> freezes during runtime.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I noticed a few things -
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> First when initializing the QSharedMemory object there isn't a call to
</I>&gt;<i> QSharedMemory::lock() before attempting to zero out the memory space. (and then
</I>&gt;<i> subsequent unlock) That was creating sporadic crashes, at least on my MacBookPro.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That was easy enough to solve but I will have to go through the rest of the code
</I>&gt;<i> at some point to do locks and unlocks.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other thing I noticed is that the &quot;extern struct&quot; in common.h on the C++
</I>&gt;<i> side doesn't match the common/jtcom on the Fortran side. There are 32 extra
</I>&gt;<i> bytes on the C++ side and I was wondering what I'm missing. I noticed that
</I>&gt;<i> jt9com is NOT &quot;jt9com_&quot; and I've yet to figure where that declaration is coming
</I>&gt;<i> from.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, thanks for your great program.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> With kind regards,
