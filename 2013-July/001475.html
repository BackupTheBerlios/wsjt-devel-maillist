<PRE>Hi Murray,

Thanks for sharing your initial ideas on improvements to the &quot;Default 
Frequancies&quot; tab.  A few reactions follow:

</I>
It would be nice if we could count on it being so simple.  At present 
this rule is nominally followed on 80, 40, 20, 17, 15, and 10m.  I think 
160m and 12m could also follow the +2 kHz rule. (They don't now, but 
arguably this hardly matters since there hasn't much JT9 activity there 
yet.)  60m is a special case with its fixed channels, so I guess the two 
modes should have the same default frequency.  On 30 m we have a 
problem: already JT65 and WSPR are very close together.  Maybe we should 
advocate moving JT65 down by 2 or 3 kHz... but I hesitate to try to 
&quot;legislate&quot; such things without asking for community input.
the same frequency

</I>
It seems to me that a 3-column table is best: a JT65 frequency, a JT9 
frequency, and a column for antenna type.  We'll need to think about how 
to implement which column is selected for use when a band selection is 
executed.

I would welcome any thoughts from others...
