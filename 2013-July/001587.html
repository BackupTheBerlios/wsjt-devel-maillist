</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Thanks for the very useful report on your investigation of audio

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> We could decide not to use the QAudio classes, after all -- we 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> already know that PortAudio serves our purpose well.  We can put 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> mutexes around transfers of information to/from the sound threads, to

</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That wasn't what I was suggesting in my post above. Mutexes will block 
</I>&gt;<i> and are unsuitable for low latency processing as in the streaming 
</I>&gt;<i> callback.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would replace the use of bare bool/int to communicate between user 
</I>&gt;<i> threads and interrupt level with atomic variables Qt (5 at least) 
</I>&gt;<i> provides QAtomic... objects which are a fairly easy replacement if the 
</I>&gt;<i> right memory mode is selected.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Also because the sampling thread doesn't run an event loop (no call to 
</I>&gt;<i> exec() in the run method) it cannot process Qt events or Qt slots in 
</I>&gt;<i> the thread. This means that care must be taken to synchronize member 
</I>&gt;<i> function calls that communicate with the run() method since they run 
</I>&gt;<i> in the GUI thread.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If the Qt5 switch is certain for the next release, I can try and code 
</I>&gt;<i> a version of SoundInThread that I think will be safer and still low 
</I>&gt;<i> latency.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively SoundInThread could be refactored to the &quot;Qt way&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> running a local event loop in its thread and using an asynchronous 
</I>&gt;<i> timer to schedule processing (it currently uses a blocking sleep). 
</I>&gt;<i> That way I think it could asynchronously respond to signals in a 
</I>&gt;<i> thread safe way.
</I>Actually thinking this through properly; the sound in class probably 
doesn't need a separate thread at all. I wonder if anyone has tried an 
implementation that uses a timer to mark out the FFT samples rather than 
the blocking sleep?

The atomic operations or some other lock free mechanism like a counting 
semaphore would still be needed to synchronise access to the samples 
buffer between the GUI thread and the interrupt callback, but I don't 
see any obvious need for a thread here. Am I missing something?
