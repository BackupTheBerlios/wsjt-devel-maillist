</I>I'm afraid it's not very concise as there were many changes :(

The main criteria was that &quot;pull&quot; processed i/o doesn't block the user 
context so doesn't require the extra level of complexity of a separate 
thread.

A secondary criteria was that Qt plays better with properly functioning 
QObject instances. By properly functioning I mean joining the main tree 
of QObjects in the GUI thread or, if in a separate thread with a local 
event loop. This means that the object class can be extended easily to 
provide extra features asynchronously and safely. As an example, I made 
the start(device) and stop() Qt slots - the object instance can then be 
connected to signals elsewhere, for example the &quot;Monitor&quot; button signals 
probably could be connected directly. I added a stop() call to the 
beginning of start() to make these slots() impossible to misuse because 
signal/slot communication can be hard sequence deterministically, so 
allowing for miss-ordering seemed sensible.

I also took the opportunity to try and improve some class invariants, 
for example having a setDevice() setter made little sense since the 
audio processing cannot be done without a device (modulo using the 
default input device) and the processing cannot start without a device 
number. The re-factoring away from a run method with no arguments to a 
start(device) slot enforces what is really an invariant.

I changed the close semantics to simply let the SoundInput object 
instance get destroyed and it in turn aborts and closes the portaudio 
stream and device. This should make program shut down cleaner and faster 
as it doesn't have to join the separate thread with a wait. This removed 
code in a couple places in the main window class that managed the 
SoundInThread instance and its thread. Note that there is no stop() call 
in the destructor; this is deliberate as stop processes pending sound 
buffers whereas the destructor just closes the stream without stopping 
it which abandons any pending processing therefore shutting down more 
quickly.

Examples of the issues I saw:
     A blocking call to sleep in a loop where none was needed. QTimer 
provides a non-blocking asynchronous mechanism to achieve the same 
functionality.

     A slot on a QThread object (SoundInThread::quit()) that could never 
work due to the lack of an event loop because there was no call to 
QCoreApplication::exec() in the thread run() method. In fact a direct 
call to exec() could not be implemented since the processing loop would 
have to be exited to get there. Compounding this, the quit() method was 
called directly from the GUI thread which is not thread safe.

     Several methods on SoundInThread were called from the GUI thread 
and changing variables that were shared with the run() method which runs 
in a different thread. These are thread unsafe and subject to race 
conditions or other thread safety issues as described in a prior post.

     The SoundInThread::run() method emits a Qt signal (readyForFFT()) 
which gets connected to a GUI thread object (MainWindow), this was the 
only part of the class that actually used thread safe inter-thread 
communication since the Qt signal/slot mechanism uses thread safe event 
queuing between threads. Because no thread is really required; the 
signal delivery will be MUCH faster in the single threaded version 
because it becomes a simple function call between objects.
