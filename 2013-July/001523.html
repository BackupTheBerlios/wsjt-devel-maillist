<PRE>I've spent much of today working on optimizations of the JT65 and JT9 
decoders in WSJT-X.

I set up a benchmark test in which N=368 recorded *.wav files were 
processed by different versions of WSJT-X.  (The recordings were made 
over the past few days, mostly on 20 m, but also a few at 30m and 40m.)

Revisions r3487 and r3492 were the principal test cases.  Both produced 
744 decodes of JT9 signals and 1343 decodes of JT65 signals.  WSJT-X 
r3487 took a total of 1659.3 seconds and r3492 300.6 seconds -- a 
speed-up factor 5.52, from an average of 4.5 seconds per file to 0.82 s 
per file.  I'm sure that users will appreciate the improved performance.

I propose that we release SVN revision 3492 as WSJT-X Version 1.1.
Several questions:

1. Does anyone see any problem with this plan?

2. For AC6SL: John, are you OK with making a Linux installation package 
from r3492?  We'll need to include advice to Linux users to download the 
kvasd executable from my web site, rather than making it part of the 
.deb package.

3. For G4LKA: John, what can we do about a downloadable WSJT-X for
OS X?  I don't know anything about Mac packages.  I suppose s 
click-to-install package would be best, but a tarfile or equivalent, 
with a few instructions, would be much better than nothing.  Can either 
of these be done?
