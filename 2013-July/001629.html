<PRE>Hi Bill and all,

My quick-and-dirty Qt-Audio-based soundin code seems to work fine in 
Windows, but so far is not fully successful in Linux.  Probably I've 
made coding errors; I haven't yet traced down the different behavior.

</I>
As I see it:

Advantages for Portaudio:
1. The coding has already been done, and we know that it works well in 
Windows, Linux, and OS X.
2. It provides access to all available Windows sound APIs (MME, DirectX, 
WASAPI, WDM-KS, ASIO).

Advantages for QAudio
1. No need for a sound library external to Qt.
2. Integration with the rest of Qt is seamless.
3. Who needs all those other APIs, if the one presented by QAudio works 
well?  (Note that no program in the WSJT suite needs super-low 
latencies, etc.)

My vote, assuming that it will accommodate all reasonable audio devices, 
is for QAudio.  But I will not be devastated if we eventually decide 
that Portaudio serves our needs better.

Bill, my suggestion is that you do the sound out changes using QAudio 
rather than Portaudio.  We can then test it in Linux and OS X, as well 
as your Windows tests.  If all seems well, then you can convert your 
sound input code to QAudio.  (You'll probably want to ignore my QAudio 
code, except maybe to see what I did.  I'm sure I have made mistakes there.)

Comments and opinions from others?

I will follow this message with another one recommending that we should 
soon release WSJT-X version 1.1.1 as a beta.

	-- Joe, K1JT
