&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your comments and the patch.  Will try it out ASAP.

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> HI hi Joe, I should have kept quiet about that issue or not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> fixed it myself. My patch is probably going to conflict
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with your fix. I'll prepare another patch file against r3516.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It's OK either way.  Maybe your fix is better than my fix?  I haven't

</I>&gt;<i> If you like my fix, a patch against r3516 would be fine.
</I>I just put a setXIT in the step just before tx starts but I think your 
is better since the user will see the radio VFOs set well before PTT 
whereas the last minute VFO set might confuse them.

I'll make a new patch and post it. Please ignore the patch a couple of 
posts ago.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW: I asked a while ago if you wouldn't prefer to have write access 
</I>&gt;<i> to the SVN repository.  Let me know, if so.
</I>Yes, I didn't miss that Joe. I am being a bit cautious until I am more 
comfortable with the code base, after all I've only been looking at it 
for a couple of days. I am quite happy to have write access if it is ok 
with you.
