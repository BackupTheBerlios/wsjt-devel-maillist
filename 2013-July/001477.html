<PRE>Hi Joe

How about a 3 column table:  label, frequency, antenna.  The label 
appears in the drop down menu and by default would be &quot;20M&quot;, &quot;30M&quot; etc 
as we currently have.  We could give the drop down menu a few more 
characters and make it editable.  The user could assign any combination 
that he may want eg:

20M  V     14076000        GP vertical
20M  V     14078000        GP vertical
20M  L     14078000        Delta loop at 15M
30M  L     10139000        Delta loop at 15M
etc

The display on the main window remains much as it is, perhaps the label 
(the drop down menu) will need a little extra room.  This is versatile 
and the label can reveal the currently selected antenna without needing 
to display the entire antenna description text on the main window.

It also allows for other bands, a point that was raised in another email.

Then again, given that many antennas are multiband, perhaps we shouldn't 
tie the antenna to the frequency selector at all. Another drop down menu 
with editable label and associated text field:

Ant 1        GP Vertical
Ant 2        Delta loop at 15M
etc

It just means we need to find room for another small drop down menu on 
the main window, assuming we think that its important enough to warrant 
that exposure?


Hmm, sorry, in trying to keep this simple it seems to have become more 
complex!

Cheers
