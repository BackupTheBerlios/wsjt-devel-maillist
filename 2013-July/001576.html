<PRE>Hi Bill,

&gt;<i> OK, but this is not a good reason. For example...

</I>&gt;<i> background service type decoder.
</I>
Of course there are a million ways these things could have been done. 
What you see is the way I decided to do it -- and my reasons (as far as 
I can remember them) were good enough for me.

My goals have been to create tools and capabilities not otherwise 
available in ham radio, and to package them in a functional way that 
attracts many users.

&gt;<i> I would like to contribute and
</I>&gt;<i> as a professional software engineer I think my most helpful
</I>&gt;<i> contributions might be in refactoring some of the structural design to
</I>&gt;<i> reflect best practice. It would be great as a user with s/w development
</I>&gt;<i> experience to be able to contribute to this project since I feel it will
</I>&gt;<i> be very successful. I doubt if I could contribute much to the math and
</I>&gt;<i> DSP side even though I have worked on embedded audio and video
</I>&gt;<i> applications :(
</I>
We'll be happy to have you aboard.  The group already has others with 
professional programming qualifications and experience far beyond mine. 
  Anyone here should feel free to propose and code structural changes 
that improve the performance, reliability, maintainability, user 
friendliness, etc., of our programs.  If a new approach can be shown to 
yield a clear advantage in one or more of these areas, it should not be 
hard to convince others that changes are desirable.

...

Now, on thread safety, etc:

&gt;<i> Some programmers make the boolean variable &quot;volatile&quot; ...
</I>&gt;<i> ...
</I>&gt;<i> These programmers throw scorn at the programmers that use &quot;volatile&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> variables because ...
</I>
I'm not much into throwing scorn, but yes, I understand volatility ... 
and also that (as you write)

&gt;<i> Threads are difficult and should only be used when absolutely necessary,
</I>&gt;<i> and then only very carefully.
</I>
This was, indeed, a contributing motivation for my writing the decoder 
as an independent process.

&gt;<i> I had a quick look at the Qt multimedia library and I'm not sure it fits
</I>&gt;<i> the required model very well. I see a way of recording audio to a file
</I>&gt;<i> (QAudioRecorder) and a way of probing the samples as they are recorded
</I>&gt;<i> (QAudioProbe).
</I>
It probably requires more than a quick look.

When I started work (about two years ago) on what became MAP65 v2.0, I 
used classes QAudioInput and QAudioOutput.  They worked well; but the 
code packaged with Qt 4.x did not support sample rates above 48 kHz and 
I needed 4-channel, 96 kHz sampling for MAP65.  So I switched to using 
PortAudio.

WSJT-X does not need 96 kHz sampling, and anyway Qt5 has removed the 
48-kHz rate restriction.  It should not be too difficult to go back to 
using QAudioInput/QAudioOutput.  Edson (PY2SDR) is also looking into 
good ways to handle this task.

&gt;<i> I am currently implementing a few ideas in a test framework to try and
</I>&gt;<i> develop a framework for WS type programs. I am looking a cleaner cross
</I>&gt;<i> platform building, better GUI state handling, better fortran integration
</I>&gt;<i> and, use of modern C++ programming techniques. I will try and plug in
</I>&gt;<i> existing functionality as I go along to see how I can minimize the
</I>&gt;<i> disruptive effect of any structural changes I propose.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Expect more questions along these lines as I dig deeper into the
</I>&gt;<i> functionality.
</I>
We look forward to seeing your proposal(s).

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
