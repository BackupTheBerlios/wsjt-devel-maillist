<PRE>Hi Bill,

If we let the main event loop take care of the notifications for when a
sample buffer is ready, it may provide the necessary sync without the need
of semaphores. Using only one event loop will (I think) guarantee that only
one function will have access to the sample buffer.

In Qt4, there were some serious issues with QAudioInput/QAudioOutput and
threads. The issues were supposed to be fixed in Qt5, but I haven't looked
closely into this yet.

Joe, what do you think restoring the recording to a wave file instead of
shared memory? Since the longer JT9 modes have been retired, the size of
the file should not be too large. This could, in principle, simplify the
audio handling and testing.
