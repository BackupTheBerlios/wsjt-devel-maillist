Hi John,
&gt;<i> Bill,
</I>Thanks for taking a look at this. I have made the dialog fully 
resizeable so hopefully it displays correctly on OS-X too.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I like the general layout in that it merges the various Configuration/Setup options into a coherent set of panels.   One useful change is removing the confusion (that has been reported to me) over the difference between CAT Port and PTT Port.   Renaming Cat Port -&gt; Serial Port  and PTT port -&gt; CAT port  is more logical.
</I>I'm not sure I follow here. CAT port and serial port may be different or 
the same with my current configuration code. The actual working 
configuration screen uses stricter widget disables than before to 
restrict the available options to the ones that make sense, so that may 
help with any confusion. Also I have tried to write more extensive tool 
tips as reminders of the functionality.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> However, this means changing naming conventions in  wsjtx.ini   .   What do you propose here?    It means that an older wsjtx.ini cannot be imported to overwrite the new one.
</I>I've made a couple of changes recently that cause keys in the .INI file 
to be renamed. Obsolete keys are not really a problem and writing code 
to do automatic upgrades is hardly worth the effort since it gets 
complicated very quickly and leaves historical baggage in the code base. 
IMHO just announcing in the release note for a version that certain 
configuration options will need resetting after an upgrade is probably 
the best overall solution.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> At present,  CAT ports (later Serial Port) list a lot of COM or USB options, but until I added &quot;User&quot; this list was not user-extensible.   (&quot;User&quot; can be replaced by an addition in wsjtx.ini - see page 5 footnote in User Guide.)   Something like this needs to be added to PTT port (later CAT port).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I would prefer that instead of having to edit wsjtx.ini to add a user specific driver to the serial list, there should be a panel/box where additions can be made.  Same for the PTT/CAT box.    Ideally, users should not have to edit wsjtx.ini at all.   User definable options/additions should be on the configuration panel
</I>I think the best route here is the one taken by hamlib. They simple 
allow '/dev/rig' as the CAT device and the user is expected to make a 
symlink to the actual device. This is the Posix way of handling custom 
device names and I don't see any real problems with it (apart from on 
Windows but that is another story). Hamlib has a default device of 
'/dev/rig' which we don't currently allow but could easily do so. We 
could do the same with '/dev/ptt' for example.
