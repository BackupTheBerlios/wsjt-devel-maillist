<PRE>Hi Joe

Some basic documentation for DXCC entity and worked B4 status is 
attached.  I've just added it here as plain text; I can't produce 
reliable docx files under Linux.

I noticed in the list of system requirements (Users Guide version 1.2 
page 4) the monitor required is 1024 x 768.  I use a little netbook for 
portable operation with only 1024 x 600 and its just fine.  Although 
you've got to be quick, the Atom CPU can take most of the available 10 
seconds to decode sometimes!

Cheers

-------------- next part --------------
Show DXCC entity and worked B4 status

This adds the name of the DXCC entity and whether you've worked this entity and/or call before to any CQ calls displayed in the Band Activity window.  It considers JT9 and JT65 to be the same mode but does differentiate between bands. 

While it will work on the Windows version of WSJT-X it is mainly intended Linux and Mac users.  Windows users can (and should) use VK3AMA's excellent JT-Alert utility available from <A HREF="http://ham-apps.com">http://ham-apps.com</A>

Your worked before status is displayed as a single character with a change of background colour:
	!  (bright green) New DXCC entity
	~  (mid green) You've already worked this DXCC entity but not this station.
	   (dull green) You've previously worked the calling station.

Following the above is the DXCC entity name abbreviated if required to fit the available space.

Requirements

WSJTX expects the file cty.dat installed in wsjtx_install.  This contains the DXCC data, is regularly updated and can be downloaded from <A HREF="http://www.country-files.com/cty/">http://www.country-files.com/cty/</A>

Your previous history is read from wsjtx_log.adi (found in wsjtx_install).  This file is updated every time you log a  QSO from WSJT-X (but note that it can also be erased from the file menu). You can append or overwrite this file by exporting your QSO history as an ADIF file from another logging program.  Turning 'Show DXCC entity and worked B4 status' off and on again will cause WSJT-X to re-read this log file.  Note that very large ADIF log files may cause WSJT-X to slow down while searching for calls.
