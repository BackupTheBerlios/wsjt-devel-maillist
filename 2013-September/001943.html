</I>Ah OK, there are similar issues with Linux since distros started using 
udev for device management. In that case it's pretty straightforward to 
add a custom udev rule to reincarnate the custom device on reboot.

Looking for a similar feature on OS-X doesn't reveal much of any use.

It is possible to have editable items in a combo box, that is probably 
the best way to allow for a custom device without having users delve 
into configuration files. I'll have a go at adding that to my current 
configuration changes with the user entered item(s) being saved in the 
.ini file.

I have looked at enumerating the actual available serial devices but 
this is a whole can of worms in itself (with a nested can of more worms 
when hot-plugged devices like USB get included), I will also revisit 
that when I get the basic rig control working the way I think it should.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> CAT port and serial port may be different or the same with my current configuration code.
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.  It's just that the proposed naming convention is more logical (I think).  I assumed in your scheme  Serial port   would appear in wsjtx.ini  as SerialPort   and   CATPort would be so named although CATport already exists in wsjtx.ini but is used for something else.     It would be better for names in wsjtx.ini to match with names (if possible) on the configuration panel
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> IMHO just announcing in the release note for a version that certain configuration options will need resetting after an upgrade is probably the best overall solution.
</I>&gt;<i> Agreed.
