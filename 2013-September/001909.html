<PRE>Hi All,

currently I am trying to clean up the code related to transceiver 
control. This started out as a small project to add OmniRig as a new 
means of transceiver control. This project has grown into a revamp of 
the implementation of the configuration dialog and transceiver control 
in general.

This is all going well and is basically complete. But I have found that 
there are several problems with transceiver control as currently 
implemented. They mostly boil down to either the libraries we use doing 
blocking system calls or having to insert delays because it is easy to 
overrun the transceiver CAT command interface. Here are some examples:

Using hamlib to control a radio via a serial port, the library uses 
blocking read_string() calls which might take some time or even timeout 
if CAT commands are corrupted or lost. This one gets particularly 
sluggish if the serial connection is lost.

Using HRD, to implement split on some radios I have to send at least 
three commands (switch VFO, set frequency, swicth VFO), if these are 
sent in quick succession, on some radios (my Icom 756 for example) the 
result is not what is expected. This is really an HRD defect but I doubt 
we will get that fixed. I can work around it by inserting sleeps before 
each command.

Using OmniRig, OmniRig appears to poll the radio independently of 
information requests and cache the results. This has a side effect that 
a read frequency command immediately after opening the OmniRig 
connection will fail. Again I think this a defect in the OmniRig server, 
but I work around by inserting delays again.

Both HRD and DX Lab Suite Commander are queried and controlled via a 
TCP/IP socket. Currently our implementation uses blocking waits for 
replies, since these are on the local loopback port there are no real 
communication delays, but the program at the other end may (and does in 
some cases) take some time to return replies.

There are other similar issues. It seems to me that it may be worth 
moving the whole &quot;talking to radios&quot; functionality off to a separate 
thread and have the main GUI thread send messages to it, with subsequent 
actions being continued on the return of a signal. This adds two areas 
of complexity, firstly the inter thread communications and secondly the 
splitting of main thread code into separate asynchronous parts around 
transceiver control operations. The former is easily done with the 
thread safe Qt signal and slot queued connection mechanism, the latter 
is a bit more disruptive. And example would go something like:

Current (pseudo) code:

fn()
{
    do A
    set Radio frequency
    do B
}

new code:

fn1()
{
    do A
    send set Radio frequency message
}

fn2() // called asynchronously when radio frequency has been changed
{
    do B
}

obviously it's not quite that simple since fn2() has to know that it is 
being called because of fn1()'s action rather than some other set 
frequency message.

In the case of regular queries like tracking the transceiver frequency 
the implementation could change to a periodic signal fired from the 
transceiver control thread automatically rather than polling from the 
main thread. In this case the main thread code would probably be less 
complex and some of the transceiver libraries we use already have an 
automatic transceiver status change signalling mechanism for this very 
purpose.

The reason for this proposal is that all these potentially indeterminate 
blocking operations are disrupting the continuous processing of incoming 
and outgoing signals. Even though we are storing and synthesising sound 
samples in a separate thread, we still require a very responsive GUI 
thread for FFT calculations and related waterfall updates. More 
generally; any blocking operation in a GUI thread is a &quot;bad smell&quot; that 
usually leads to problems.

Thoughts?
