Hi Joe,
&gt;<i> Bill and all,

</I>&gt;<i> A few comments on the transceiver control woes.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree that blocking operations in the GUI thread are potential 
</I>&gt;<i> problems (unless we know that the maximum blocked time is acceptably 
</I>&gt;<i> small).  Some months ago I ran into this problem when using hamlib 
</I>&gt;<i> calls -- for example with my TS-2000, which requires setting 
</I>&gt;<i> serial_handshake=Hardware.  With the standard hamlib routines compiled 
</I>&gt;<i> from hamlib-1.2.15.3, this caused the program to hang &quot;forever&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> OK1ZIA helped me to solve the problem.  After adding:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> options.c_cc[VTIME] = rp-&gt;timeout / 100; // VTIME in deciseconds, 
</I>&gt;<i> rp-&gt;timeout in miliseconds
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> into serial_setup() before tcflush(), we fould that all works correctly.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't know whether this required change has made it into the 
</I>&gt;<i> official hamlib repository.  But Bill, it should definitely go into 
</I>&gt;<i> the source from which you are building the hamlib routines.
</I>The repo master branch for hamlib has:

   /*
    * VTIME in deciseconds, rp-&gt;timeout in miliseconds
    */
   options.c_cc[VTIME] = (rp-&gt;timeout + 99) / 100;
   options.c_cc[VMIN] = 1;

at that location which is ok I think.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I minimized the use of multiple threads in early development of 
</I>&gt;<i> WSJT-X, mainly because I was just learning my way around Qt.  I agree 
</I>&gt;<i> that we may now be best served by putting rig control into a separate 
</I>&gt;<i> thread.
</I>Ok, this isn't something to be taken on lightly. I will get my basic 
changes in that area in first and then think about a strategy for moving 
to a threaded transceiver control option.

In the mean time I have been setting up for a fully static build of 
wsjtx.exe and jt9.exe. This is not a trival exercise as there are many 
deficiencies in teh Qt5 static build process. Nevertheless I have 
succeeded, on Windows where it matters most, and I would like to push 
out an &quot;alpha test&quot; version of wsjtx for other developers to test. The 
static linking allows me to push out executables without an installer or 
interfering with existing installations. This is purely to get test 
coverage of different transceivers and CAT interfaces. I have tested 
direct CAT with Icom 756 and CT-17 interface, same hardware via OmniRig 
and same radio via DX Lab Suite Commander and a microHam interface. If 
it is OK with you Joe I would like to proceed with this with dev group 
members.
