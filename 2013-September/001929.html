&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>Hi Joe and All,

I've been a bit bogged down with other issues and have only just got 
around to looking at what I can do to reduce this issue list. A couple 
of updates below.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm happy to be back in the fold, after two weeks of relaxation on the 
</I>&gt;<i> beach, sailing on tidal ponds, etc., etc., in beautiful Rhode Island.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still getting caught up on email traffic, but here's what I've 
</I>&gt;<i> isolated as potentially important issues for WSJT-X:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Several users report that Tx audio &quot;stutters&quot; when a window is 
</I>&gt;<i> minimized or maximized.  When using PortAudio, this problem was 
</I>&gt;<i> addressed (and solved) by increasing the size of low-level buffers in 
</I>&gt;<i> soundout.  Something similar probably needs to be done in the present 
</I>&gt;<i> code.
</I>I'll have a go at putting a buffer size control into the main code. I'm 
not sure if it will help as the o/p buffers are pretty large already but 
it's worth a try. My pending configuration changes will definitely help 
because I don't create a new configuration dialog every time it is 
invoked, instead it is created at startup and shown/hidden by the normal 
exec() - accept()|reject() mechanism.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Qt setVoloume() has a bug that reduces the Tx audio level by (I 
</I>&gt;<i> think) 6 dB.  I suggest that we obviate this issue for now by using 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;#ifdef Win32&quot; blocks to make the Tx Pwr slider act as
</I>&gt;<i> a digital gain control when compiled for Windows.  I think this means 
</I>&gt;<i> replacing the factor 32767 in line 137 of Modulator.cpp with a 
</I>&gt;<i> variable whose value is controlled by the Tx Pwr slider.  Max value 
</I>&gt;<i> would be 32767, 3277 would be -20 dB, etc.
</I>I got right through implementing this only to find that QtAudioOutput 
sets the Windows volume in QAudioOutput::open() - D'Oh! - , it uses its 
own setVolume() method which is where the bug is and therefore sets the 
volume to 50% (Windows slider scale) when it should be 100%. So we have 
no way around this unless we build Qt from source with my fix in for 
production releases. The only worry I have about this issue remaining 
unsolved for now is the wave of over driven signals when the Qt fix 
comes through and everyone gets louder after our subsequent release.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Stuck in decode?  I never see this problem, but several users say 
</I>&gt;<i> they do.  What's causing it?  Something to do with the ./.lock file 
</I>&gt;<i> shared by wsjtx.exe and jt9.exe ?
</I>As we have discussed before Joe, I suffer a jt9 hang on Linux with whole 
periods of silence, this incarnation is not a deadlock issue, it is a 
tight never ending loop in jt9 somewhere that I usually spot first from 
the hot air and fan noise from my laptop when it happens. Maybe a 
similar problem is happening on Windows even with data in the sample 
buffer. Is it worth asking if anyone who suffers this sees accompanying 
high CPU usage?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Tx at &#177; 1 kHz from desired frequency?  Is this a bug, or operator 
</I>&gt;<i> mistakes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Failure to decode first transmission in response to a CQ?  I've had 
</I>&gt;<i> a low-level concern about these reports for some time. Possibly I've 
</I>&gt;<i> seen such an issue myself, a few times, though I can't be sure.  (I 
</I>&gt;<i> certainly don't see it 70% of the time, as KB3MOW reports.)
</I>Am I correct in thinking that decoding is done on the RX DF only or in 
preference under some circumstances like double clicking the waterfall 
to decode. I would start by looking at that code to make sure it is 
benign in general decoding cycles.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6. LY2CG reports that if computer has no connection to internet. 
</I>&gt;<i> program stops working after 5 minutes, even if PSK Reporter is not 
</I>&gt;<i> checked. Edson, is something timing out after failing to connect with 
</I>&gt;<i> the PSK Reporter site?
</I>Looking at the code, it seems that we are sending local station details 
to pskreporter.info even when spotting is disabled. If so, some users 
might be surprised that they are broadcasting on the internet every five 
minutes when the pskreporter check box is not checked. I note this after 
the fixes Edson has put in to deal with DNS lookup failures causing crashes.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't list the &quot;Fortran traceback error message bug&quot; on program 
</I>&gt;<i> exit, because there really isn't one.  It's the result of some extra 
</I>&gt;<i> diagnostic code that I had put into timer.f90, and forgot to remove 
</I>&gt;<i> before building the Windows distribution package for r3563.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't yet looked at the issue concerning jt9com_.nagain, but will 
</I>&gt;<i> do so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are there other outstanding issues in WSJT-X v1.2 r3563 that need our 
</I>&gt;<i> attention?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The User's Guide should have more information on some configuration 
</I>&gt;<i> options.  Murray, would you be willing to draft some suitable text 
</I>&gt;<i> about the &quot;Show DXCC entity and worked B4 status&quot; option?  Where should
</I>&gt;<i> such things go?  It would also be good to have a section in the manual 
</I>&gt;<i> on &quot;Troubleshooting&quot;, perhaps modeled after Appendix D in the WSPR 2.0 
</I>&gt;<i> manual, starting on page 18 of
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR_2.0_User.pdf">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR_2.0_User.pdf</A> .
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone want to try drafting something similar for WSJT-X, 
</I>&gt;<i> addressing the most common user problem areas ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally: does anyone have an opinion on whether we should improve the 
</I>&gt;<i> organizational structure of our WSJT Developers Group?  Should we make 
</I>&gt;<i> better use of the facilities of the Berlios repository -- for example, 
</I>&gt;<i> bug tracking, posting of repository snapshots, etc? Other suggestions??
</I>&gt;<i> The present arrangements work, but they were never really planned... 
</I>&gt;<i> they just grew, as the several programs were being developed.
</I>Bug tracking is nice, but it the trade off is the extra maintenance of 
triage and dealing with issues that can't/won't be fixed. It might 
reduce some of the multiple reporting of issues on the mailing list if 
it were open to all (I don't know if that is an option).

I've never really understood the snapshot release mechanism, it is 
trivial, quick and, cheap to tag the repo tree for each milestone 
(release, release candidate, beta, alpha, ...). That way anyone can 
check out a prior milestone. Obviously having svn then becomes a 
requirement whereas snapshots as a zip/gzip don't but given the largish 
number of other pre-requisites for building installing subversion seems 
easy.

I would like to see a process for publishing larger scale more 
disruptive changes to the developer community. For example we are 
currently in a release phase with 1.2 hopefully nearing release. I have 
many changes that I would like to have the developer community running 
for testing purposes but am reluctant to check in because of the 
likelihood of issues that would delay 1.2. Subversion branching is the 
obvious answer but it does bring with it a whole mess of issues about 
merging changes across branches. One option is to have optional 
individual developer feature branches so any developer (or group of 
developers) could branch the main line and then would be responsible for 
merging all main line changes into their branch before merging their 
completed and approved changes back into the main line. This way any 
developer could checkout the branch and build locally to see what is 
happening. IMHO feature branches like this work well if their life span 
is reasonably short.
