</I>&gt;<i> Yes, we should definitely go to 48 kHz sample rate for audio input.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In your test code, why did you switch from using fil1.f90 (a routine 
</I>&gt;<i> from the WSPR repository) to using Bill's code that simply adds four 
</I>&gt;<i> samples?  The simple method is faster, to be sure, but I'd be 
</I>&gt;<i> surprised if fil1 is so slow that it matters much.
</I>It would be even better if it had a small enhancement to work on 
interleaved multichannel data. I think we can probably say that we only 
ever want one channel down sampled so a version that could select n'th 
of m channels would drop in cleanly.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The problem with the sum-of-4 approach is that any signals or noise in 
</I>&gt;<i> the range 6-24 kHz will be aliased into the downsampled data.  The 
</I>&gt;<i> fil1() approach is better since it applies an excellent low-pass 
</I>&gt;<i> filter before the decimation-by-4 downsampling.  Of course, most of 
</I>&gt;<i> the radios we're using shouldn't pass much of anything in that range 
</I>&gt;<i> to the audio output, so you're usually OK. Still, we might as well do 
</I>&gt;<i> it right.
</I>Joe, my non-DSP brain keeps telling me that averaging every 4 samples is 
somehow a low pass filter. Can you explain in words that I might 
understand why it still folds down signals from the upper half of the 
usable bandwidth?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Parameters in the present fil1() are not exactly what we need for 
</I>&gt;<i> WSJT-X.  The LPF cutoff frequency is 3 kHz; we'd want to move it up to 
</I>&gt;<i> 4 kHz or a bit higher.  The stopband attenuation is 60 dB; we could 
</I>&gt;<i> relax this to, say, 40 dB.  The result will be an FIR filter with a 
</I>&gt;<i> few more taps than the 37 used in fil1(), but I think speed would 
</I>&gt;<i> still be OK.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you have code that already implements the fil1() approach, I can 
</I>&gt;<i> easily produce the code for a slightly modified version of fil1.f90.
</I>&gt;<i>
