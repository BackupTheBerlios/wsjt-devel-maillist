<PRE>Hi Joe,

#5 =&gt; I have seen this a couple of times here as well. One suspicion is
that it could be related to frequency drift of the transceiver due to
temperature change, but this needs empirical evidence. I will try to
capture a wave file when this happens.

#6 =&gt; There was a bug in PSK Reporter that could cause a crash in case of a
DNS lookup failure. I have implemented some error checking to prevent the
issue and will be committing it to SVN later today.

Bug tracking could be a very useful tool.

I have been running r3563 for several days under Ubuntu and it is quite
stable.

73,

&gt;<i> Hi all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm happy to be back in the fold, after two weeks of relaxation on the
</I>&gt;<i> beach, sailing on tidal ponds, etc., etc., in beautiful Rhode Island.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm still getting caught up on email traffic, but here's what I've
</I>&gt;<i> isolated as potentially important issues for WSJT-X:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Several users report that Tx audio &quot;stutters&quot; when a window is
</I>&gt;<i> minimized or maximized.  When using PortAudio, this problem was addressed
</I>&gt;<i> (and solved) by increasing the size of low-level buffers in soundout.
</I>&gt;<i>  Something similar probably needs to be done in the present code.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. Qt setVoloume() has a bug that reduces the Tx audio level by (I think)
</I>&gt;<i> 6 dB.  I suggest that we obviate this issue for now by using &quot;#ifdef Win32&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> blocks to make the Tx Pwr slider act as
</I>&gt;<i> a digital gain control when compiled for Windows.  I think this means
</I>&gt;<i> replacing the factor 32767 in line 137 of Modulator.cpp with a variable
</I>&gt;<i> whose value is controlled by the Tx Pwr slider.  Max value would be 32767,
</I>&gt;<i> 3277 would be -20 dB, etc.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 3. Stuck in decode?  I never see this problem, but several users say they
</I>&gt;<i> do.  What's causing it?  Something to do with the ./.lock file shared by
</I>&gt;<i> wsjtx.exe and jt9.exe ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 4. Tx at &#177; 1 kHz from desired frequency?  Is this a bug, or operator
</I>&gt;<i> mistakes?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 5. Failure to decode first transmission in response to a CQ?  I've had a
</I>&gt;<i> low-level concern about these reports for some time.  Possibly I've seen
</I>&gt;<i> such an issue myself, a few times, though I can't be sure.  (I certainly
</I>&gt;<i> don't see it 70% of the time, as KB3MOW reports.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 6. LY2CG reports that if computer has no connection to internet. program
</I>&gt;<i> stops working after 5 minutes, even if PSK Reporter is not checked. Edson,
</I>&gt;<i> is something timing out after failing to connect with the PSK Reporter site?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I didn't list the &quot;Fortran traceback error message bug&quot; on program exit,
</I>&gt;<i> because there really isn't one.  It's the result of some extra diagnostic
</I>&gt;<i> code that I had put into timer.f90, and forgot to remove before building
</I>&gt;<i> the Windows distribution package for r3563.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I haven't yet looked at the issue concerning jt9com_.nagain, but will do
</I>&gt;<i> so.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Are there other outstanding issues in WSJT-X v1.2 r3563 that need our
</I>&gt;<i> attention?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The User's Guide should have more information on some configuration
</I>&gt;<i> options.  Murray, would you be willing to draft some suitable text about
</I>&gt;<i> the &quot;Show DXCC entity and worked B4 status&quot; option?  Where should
</I>&gt;<i> such things go?  It would also be good to have a section in the manual on
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Troubleshooting&quot;, perhaps modeled after Appendix D in the WSPR 2.0 manual,
</I>&gt;<i> starting on page 18 of
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/**pulsar/K1JT/WSPR_2.0_User.pdf&lt;http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR_2.0_User.pdf">http://physics.princeton.edu/**pulsar/K1JT/WSPR_2.0_User.pdf&lt;http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR_2.0_User.pdf</A>&gt;.
</I>&gt;<i> Does anyone want to try drafting something similar for WSJT-X, addressing
</I>&gt;<i> the most common user problem areas ?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Finally: does anyone have an opinion on whether we should improve the
</I>&gt;<i> organizational structure of our WSJT Developers Group?  Should we make
</I>&gt;<i> better use of the facilities of the Berlios repository -- for example, bug
</I>&gt;<i> tracking, posting of repository snapshots, etc?  Other suggestions??
</I>&gt;<i> The present arrangements work, but they were never really planned... they
</I>&gt;<i> just grew, as the several programs were being developed.
</I>&gt;<i>
