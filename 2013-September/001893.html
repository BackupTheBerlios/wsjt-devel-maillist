<PRE>Hi all,

I'm happy to be back in the fold, after two weeks of relaxation on the 
beach, sailing on tidal ponds, etc., etc., in beautiful Rhode Island.

I'm still getting caught up on email traffic, but here's what I've 
isolated as potentially important issues for WSJT-X:

1. Several users report that Tx audio &quot;stutters&quot; when a window is 
minimized or maximized.  When using PortAudio, this problem was 
addressed (and solved) by increasing the size of low-level buffers in 
soundout.  Something similar probably needs to be done in the present code.

2. Qt setVoloume() has a bug that reduces the Tx audio level by (I 
think) 6 dB.  I suggest that we obviate this issue for now by using 
&quot;#ifdef Win32&quot; blocks to make the Tx Pwr slider act as
a digital gain control when compiled for Windows.  I think this means 
replacing the factor 32767 in line 137 of Modulator.cpp with a variable 
whose value is controlled by the Tx Pwr slider.  Max value would be 
32767, 3277 would be -20 dB, etc.

3. Stuck in decode?  I never see this problem, but several users say 
they do.  What's causing it?  Something to do with the ./.lock file 
shared by wsjtx.exe and jt9.exe ?

4. Tx at &#177; 1 kHz from desired frequency?  Is this a bug, or operator 
mistakes?

5. Failure to decode first transmission in response to a CQ?  I've had a 
low-level concern about these reports for some time.  Possibly I've seen 
such an issue myself, a few times, though I can't be sure.  (I certainly 
don't see it 70% of the time, as KB3MOW reports.)

6. LY2CG reports that if computer has no connection to internet. program 
stops working after 5 minutes, even if PSK Reporter is not checked. 
Edson, is something timing out after failing to connect with the PSK 
Reporter site?

I didn't list the &quot;Fortran traceback error message bug&quot; on program exit, 
because there really isn't one.  It's the result of some extra 
diagnostic code that I had put into timer.f90, and forgot to remove 
before building the Windows distribution package for r3563.

I haven't yet looked at the issue concerning jt9com_.nagain, but will do so.

Are there other outstanding issues in WSJT-X v1.2 r3563 that need our 
attention?

The User's Guide should have more information on some configuration 
options.  Murray, would you be willing to draft some suitable text about 
the &quot;Show DXCC entity and worked B4 status&quot; option?  Where should
such things go?  It would also be good to have a section in the manual 
on &quot;Troubleshooting&quot;, perhaps modeled after Appendix D in the WSPR 2.0 
manual, starting on page 18 of
<A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR_2.0_User.pdf">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR_2.0_User.pdf</A> .
Does anyone want to try drafting something similar for WSJT-X, 
addressing the most common user problem areas ?

Finally: does anyone have an opinion on whether we should improve the 
organizational structure of our WSJT Developers Group?  Should we make 
better use of the facilities of the Berlios repository -- for example, 
bug tracking, posting of repository snapshots, etc?  Other suggestions??
The present arrangements work, but they were never really planned... 
they just grew, as the several programs were being developed.

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
