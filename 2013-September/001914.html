<PRE>Hi John,

Yes, we should definitely go to 48 kHz sample rate for audio input.

In your test code, why did you switch from using fil1.f90 (a routine 
from the WSPR repository) to using Bill's code that simply adds four 
samples?  The simple method is faster, to be sure, but I'd be surprised 
if fil1 is so slow that it matters much.

The problem with the sum-of-4 approach is that any signals or noise in 
the range 6-24 kHz will be aliased into the downsampled data.  The 
fil1() approach is better since it applies an excellent low-pass filter 
before the decimation-by-4 downsampling.  Of course, most of the radios 
we're using shouldn't pass much of anything in that range to the audio 
output, so you're usually OK.  Still, we might as well do it right.

Parameters in the present fil1() are not exactly what we need for 
WSJT-X.  The LPF cutoff frequency is 3 kHz; we'd want to move it up to 4 
kHz or a bit higher.  The stopband attenuation is 60 dB; we could relax 
this to, say, 40 dB.  The result will be an FIR filter with a few more 
taps than the 37 used in fil1(), but I think speed would still be OK.

If you have code that already implements the fil1() approach, I can 
easily produce the code for a slightly modified version of fil1.f90.

This would also solve a local (Mac) problem where although portaudio can accept a requested 12000 Hz input (even though Mac audio codec accepts only 11025)  Qt cannot do the same.

</I>&gt;<i> Bill and I spent some time a few weeks ago looking at methods to down-sample from 48000 Hz to 12000 Hz for the decoders but it is not desirable (in my view) to introduce a special scheme for Macs.  Bill has looked into why Qt cannot handle Mac requirements for 11025 and this is still pending.   I am currently using a scheme Bill suggested and am using 48000 Hz in soundin.cpp.

</I>&gt;<i> Why not leave this Qt problem and switch to 48000 Hz for both input and output along with MAP65 and WSPR?   Will this cause other problems?
