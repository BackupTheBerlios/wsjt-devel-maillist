Just a note on size:  I regularly use a netbook for working portable.  
The screen height is only 600 pixels.  Currently the main and config 
windows (including your proposed one) fit that minimal size well.

</I>&gt;<i> I need to look at how that works, I've not managed to build the hamlib

</I>&gt;<i> custom USB devices would be welcome.
</I>
I just looked at the configs for the radios I figured would not have a 
serial port; Flex, Kachina etc.  In their configurations under 'port 
type' were examples of the ports I listed.  I found it a little 
unintuitive so went the XML-RPC route instead.

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Alternatively I was thinking of adding XML-RPC to WSJT-X. Some of my 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> homebrew radios run control software on the (Linux) PC and use 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> XML-RPC to talk to Fldigi.  It was relatively easy to add and works 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> well.  Fldigi doesn't expose any options - just a simple on/off 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> checkbox.
</I>&gt;<i> The new radio interface code works through an abstract interface that 
</I>&gt;<i> needs to support a few basic radio commands like set frequency, set 
</I>&gt;<i> mode, set split frequencies, set split mode on and off, set PTT on and 
</I>&gt;<i> off and, either send and event when any of a defined set of parameter 
</I>&gt;<i> change or support a query of the same parameters. Those parameters 
</I>&gt;<i> being VFO A frequency and mode, VFO B frequency and mode if different 
</I>&gt;<i> from VFO A, Tx VFO and Rx VFO, split mode state and, PTT state. 
</I>&gt;<i> Internally there are concrete classes for each type of interface 
</I>&gt;<i> (hamlib, DX Lab Suite Commander, HRD, OmniRig). Adding a new type of 
</I>&gt;<i> interface will be pretty simple if it can do those functions. There is 
</I>&gt;<i> also a bit of factory boilerplate to instantiate an implementation 
</I>&gt;<i> along with registering some static values to allow the configuration 
</I>&gt;<i> dialog to understand the capabilities without actually having to 
</I>&gt;<i> create a radio type.
</I>
Obviously XML-RPC knows nothing about radios.  It'll handle whatever 
command we like.  Fldigi's list is actually much more extensive that I 
remembered, see <A HREF="http://www.w1hkj.com/FldigiHelp-3.22/xmlrpc-control.html">http://www.w1hkj.com/FldigiHelp-3.22/xmlrpc-control.html</A>
I'm thinking only of doing a bare minimum, ie what you listed above.  
However it may be useful to some people if I include logging commands 
too.  That way WSJT could use Fldigi or Fllog for logging (and I guess 
others that share Fldigi's protocol).


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The biggest problem is testing all the possible radio types multiplied 
</I>&gt;<i> by four for the different ways of interfacing. Unfortunately CAT 
</I>&gt;<i> protocols are nowhere near standardised and each of the interfaces 
</I>&gt;<i> fail in some way to hide the differences.
</I>True, but then isn't that what Hamlib is supposed to alleviate?  I like 
to think of WSJT as being experimental software rather than a commercial 
product. That excuses a lot! :-)
