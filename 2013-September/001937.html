Hi Murray,
&gt;<i> Well done Bill, looks good.
</I>Thanks, it was done in a bit of a rush today when I realised that adding 
the few new options I needed would grow the existing dialog to a rather 
large size.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would the radio interface expose alternative port types?  It would 
</I>&gt;<i> appear HamLib supports USB,  Device driver(?), UDP etc. But then I 
</I>&gt;<i> imagine the configuration GUI has to change for each different port 
</I>&gt;<i> type - bit of a pain.
</I>I need to look at how that works, I've not managed to build the hamlib 
source with USB support here, on Windows, and I don't have a direct USB 
controlled radio to test with. The hamlib developers are currently 
re-factoring the library to a monolithic build with no run-time shared 
library loading. It will be interesting to see how that works out and 
how big the resulting library is. I though the radios that did have USB 
interfaces emulated a serial port so any information on those with 
custom USB devices would be welcome.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Alternatively I was thinking of adding XML-RPC to WSJT-X. Some of my 
</I>&gt;<i> homebrew radios run control software on the (Linux) PC and use XML-RPC 
</I>&gt;<i> to talk to Fldigi.  It was relatively easy to add and works well.  
</I>&gt;<i> Fldigi doesn't expose any options - just a simple on/off checkbox.
</I>The new radio interface code works through an abstract interface that 
needs to support a few basic radio commands like set frequency, set 
mode, set split frequencies, set split mode on and off, set PTT on and 
off and, either send and event when any of a defined set of parameter 
change or support a query of the same parameters. Those parameters being 
VFO A frequency and mode, VFO B frequency and mode if different from VFO 
A, Tx VFO and Rx VFO, split mode state and, PTT state. Internally there 
are concrete classes for each type of interface (hamlib, DX Lab Suite 
Commander, HRD, OmniRig). Adding a new type of interface will be pretty 
simple if it can do those functions. There is also a bit of factory 
boilerplate to instantiate an implementation along with registering some 
static values to allow the configuration dialog to understand the 
capabilities without actually having to create a radio type.

The biggest problem is testing all the possible radio types multiplied 
by four for the different ways of interfacing. Unfortunately CAT 
protocols are nowhere near standardised and each of the interfaces fail 
in some way to hide the differences.

I plan to write a stand alone program to exercise the radio interface 
with built in data logging and want to push it out to anyone in the user 
base who is willing to try it so I can get coverage of the variables.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> BTW you have a typo in the tool tip for the frequencies tab.
</I>Thanks, I've found 10 or so other errors but missed that one so there 
are bound to be a few more :(
