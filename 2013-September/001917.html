<PRE>Bill, John --

Bill, in answer to your question: yes, summing groups of 4 samples is a 
low-pass filter of sorts.  It's just not a very good one.  Voltage 
attenuation for it goes as sin(x)/x (x is frequency) -- so in-band 
ripple is rather large and the aliased high-frequency components are not 
attenuated by very much.

I'll make a new LPF-and-downsample routine similar to fil1() but with a 
higher f_cutoff and somewhat smaller stopband attenuation.  I'll keep it 
simple for now, just a single channel.  (It will be easy to generalize 
it if/when we need to use it for two or more channels.)

Incidental question: what is the store() function, line 52 in 
Detector.cpp?  I can't see where it is defined.

</I>&gt;<i> I started with fil1 since it was immediately on hand.   Then Bill came up with a different scheme in Audio Device and I tested that later - and then left it in place.   fil1 worked fine and since it involved a low pass filter we (Bill and I) thought this might be important - and waited for your comments.   I did even try using a routine in libsamplerate but this was much too slow and only a few decodes would be made in a given cycle.

</I>&gt;<i> I would be glad to have a modified version of fil1 and will try it.   I can send you a couple of .wav files with the current fil1 and then again with the new one.
