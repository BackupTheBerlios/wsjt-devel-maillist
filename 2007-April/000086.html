Diane,

I am afraid I can not help with this. Portaudio is no more in coocer. I
downloaded src.rpm package and compilled portaudio-19 and
portaudio-19-devel rpms.

portaudio-19.rpm was installed in /usr/lib/
portaudio 0.18 was not destroied.
portaudio-19-devel was in conflict with version 0.18 devel package and I
could not install it.

So I do not know how it will be in next Mandriva release. BTW Mandriva
changed release cycle from one year to 6 month. The last Spring edition
Mandriva 2007.1 was released and I saw there are versions of portaudio
0.18 and 0.19 in the officials. But I did not install 2007.1 yet to say
exactly how it is.

I think for now the best solution for Mandriva is the old way of using
ported code of portaudio. Perhaps it is possible to have that option in
configure too.
