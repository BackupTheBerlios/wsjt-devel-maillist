<PRE>Joe Taylor napisa&#322;(a):
&gt;<i> Hi Piotr,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Joe,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> This is exactly the same problem I've experienced compiling 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'with-alsa'. Samplerate
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> shown here is very the same. Compiling without ALSA did not work too 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - WSJT
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is not decoding sigs from-air and wav examples. I'm not a Linux geek, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> so I can only
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> beta-test.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> WSJT is the last piece of software that prevents me to port my 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> virtual life into Linux box.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Clearly we should find the cause of this problem, and fix it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As you will have gathered from the messages I sent earlier today to 
</I>&gt;<i> the wsjt-devel list, it has been quite a while since I used WSJT with 
</I>&gt;<i> alsa sound compiled in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It compiles and runs on my system now, but something is obviously 
</I>&gt;<i> wrong with configuration of the audio input stream.  James 
</I>&gt;<i> Courtier-Dutton is the author of the ALSA startup code for WSJT, and 
</I>&gt;<i> he is an alsa developer.  I am sure he can help us to find the problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I have re-read your earlier message in which you say that you can 
</I>&gt;<i> compile OK with portaudio, and the program appears to run OK, but does 
</I>&gt;<i> not seem to decode JT65 signals properly.  Can you give us further 
</I>&gt;<i> details?  Is the audio level correct (i.e., around 0 dB) ? Does the 
</I>&gt;<i> waterfall look normal?  Does the &quot;green line&quot; look reasonable?  Does 
</I>&gt;<i> the program decode OK in FSK441 mode?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Many of us have used WSJT successfully under linux, so I am sure we 
</I>&gt;<i> can find the solution to your problem.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     -- Joe, K1JT
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Joe - RRR !

I have just messed up moon-net with wsjt-devel - same account.
I will do some new tests with newer WSJT source code from Harry LZ1BB 
and optionally
the one provided by apt-get (seems to be the different one) then I will
prepare a report.

During my last (portaudio) tests the waterfall looked pretty normal, 
there was nice 'like always' traces on it when
receiving real EME. But all I've got was few decodes then NIL for rest 
of my tests. Audio level = 0dB.
Even strong samples (RU1AA -12, W5UN -13) never produced right decodes, 
in spite of sharp red peak in good
place on frequency axis. Very the same with JT65 wav's included in Joe's 
tutorial.
Every function seems to work properly but no decodes at all. If I 
haven't checked the decoding I would never know that something is wrong.
This resembles to me similar problems what Harry got few months ago with 
one of his linux machines.

FSK test will be done now, did not tested it after JT65 test failed.

As far as I know portaudio does some use of ALSA, maybe it's time to get 
rid of
'--with-alsa' option as obsolete ?

73!
