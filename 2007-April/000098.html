<PRE>I'm trying to compile WSJT wsjt-5.9.6.r309 on FC6.  I am able to run the
pre-compiled binary FB,
but I want to try to change some things (first order of business being
rig control PTT for my K2).
I can hardly be considered a WSJT developer, but Joe kindly invited me
to join this list.

The BuildRequires dependencies in the RPM spec file don't quite match
up, as Fedora has a habit of splitting up -lib and -devel packages
differently from others, but I was able to satisfy the requirements by
hand using yum and then do configure and make by hand.

I'm able to get through ./configure with no options and make, with a
number of warnings.  But I can't get it to run.

I get
$ python ./wsjt.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;./wsjt.py&quot;, line 9, in ?
    import Audio
ImportError: /home/klotz/redhat/SOURCES/wsjt-5.9.6.r309/Audio.so:
undefined symbol: gmtime_

It looks like it might come from get_fname.f90, but I'm not sure.  I saw
that Bob N4HY had added GetSystemTime in jtaudio.c as part of the Linux
port, but that doesn't seem to be the issue, as removing that code and
recompiling still produces the unsatisfied link error.

Has anybody seen this?  I've read the archives and not seen this problem
reported.
Is it due to version skew in the fortran compiler?  Any suggestions for
things to check?
