I'll have a crack at fixing portaudio integration a bit better
as I mentioned.

I'd suggest a code freeze date be set and at least a week of
testing after that date. That's up to you. But how about one week
for a code freeze date and one week for testing? A lot of testing
has already gone on so perhaps it can be shortened.

I have been wanting to try psk31 on HF, I will give JT65 a go as well.
