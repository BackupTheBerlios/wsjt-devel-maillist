<PRE>Joe,

Good news. I downloaded and compiled the last release. Good new
features.

Please put 10Mhz in the list. We can use PSK31 there so WSJT will not be
a problem with regulations too.

Is it possible instead of TXDF to have SINCHRON buton. So each time RX
frequency is changed software XIT to be working too. With option to lock
TX and move only RX. The feature common in each PSK31 program.

If not at least TXDF to follow RX if buton is pressed. Now this happened
only once and next RX QSY should be followed by unchecking and again
checking TXDF.

There was a question about ALSA. I am against possibility to compile
with --enable-alsa. At least in the moment. ALSA is not working. At the
same time it is default option for compilation. I helped several people
recently. All were compiling with alsa. So we changed to portaudio and
all was fine. Another argument. If only --enable-portaudio is available
it will be much closer to Windows version as adjustment in Options and
in this way WSJT will be more conventional.

At the end I would like to support Diane for freezing the new version
for some time before anouncement. It will be good period for bug
tracking and perhaps deb and rpm preparation.

73, Harry LZ1BB
