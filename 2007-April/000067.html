<PRE>Hi Diane,

I'm not sure that I have understood your question about the 
need for resampling.

&gt;<i> I made the possibly unfounded assumption you needed resample
</I>&gt;<i> only for portaudio, which was the only audio system Win32 supported.
</I>&gt;<i> Which is why was wanting to ask you about this.
</I>
WSJT wants samples at a 11025 Hz -- an exact sub-multiple of 
44100 Hz, the native hardware sample rate of nearly all 
sound cards when WSJT was designed.

More recently the standard native rate has been changed to 
48000 Hz, so the soundcard driver (or some other software) 
must handle the rate conversion.  In many cases the Windows 
drivers do the conversion in a quick-and-dirty manner that 
is sub-optimal in several ways.  One of these is that the 
resulting effective sample rate may differ from that 
requested by nearly 1% -- a big error for the JT65 mode. 
For computers afflicted in this way by poorly written 
soundcard drivers, WSJT must do the resampling again, 
thereby correcting (part of) the problem.

I have not seen any examples of a *nix machine showing this 
problem.  As far as I know, the call to resample() in 
wsjt1.F is needed only in Windows -- and only if the 
displayed sample-factor numbers are outside the approximate 
range 0.9990 to 1.0010.

&gt;&gt;<i>It sounds to me like --enable-alsa and --enable-oss are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>obsolete and should be removed.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'd agree to removing them, it just makes the configure
</I>&gt;<i> messier.
</I>
Unless we hear from James that he believes there is some 
advantage to using alsa without portaudio, I am in favor of 
removing them.

	-- Joe, K1JT
