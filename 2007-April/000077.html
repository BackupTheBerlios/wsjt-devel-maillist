It appears berlios was experiencing problems over the weekend.

The question I want to ask, is what distributions already
have portaudio v19 and where are they installing them? I am
wondering if it might be worth while checking for portaudio
in /usr/include/portaudio2 and /usr/local/include/portaudio2 etc.
e.g. FreeBSD has portaudiov19 in /usr/local/include/portauio2 and
/usr/local/lib/portaudio2; I'd like to search for those directories
if they are apparently where distributions are sticking them.

As for linking our own version of portaudio. It can be easily done
by linking in a static lib which is easily done for x86 386, the difficulty
is getting the compile flags right for 64 bit platforms. Linking
against the dynamic lib is harder because the library must be
placed into LD_LIBRARY_PATH so it can be found. Where should the
library be placed? Into /usr/local/lib/portaudio2 /usr/lib/portaudio2?
Where it might conflict with a distribution version of portaudio v19?

I'll get back to looking at the static linking in a short bit. It
has been taking some thinking and I have had other projects as well.

BTW, David Quental &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/wsjt-devel">ct1drb at iol.pt</A>&gt; solved his problem by installing
his distributions version of portaudio v19, apparently it was
installed in /usr/lib/portaudio2 with include files in
/usr/include/portaudio2. As I said, I'd like to know how common this is.
