<PRE>As Diane guessed, I'm thinking about a new WSJT release in 
the fairly near future.  A copy of &quot;Announce.txt&quot; committed 
in Rev 374 summarizes the user-level changes already made. 
I may still make further changes, including (possibly) 
merging back into &quot;trunk&quot; some improvements to the JT65 
decoder that were made some time ago in the MAP65 branch.

If you have changes you think should go into the next public 
release, now would be a good time to get them done.

BTW: one of the motivations for a new release is a 
surprising explosion of activity with JT65A on the HF bands, 
over the past month.  People are discovering that they can 
&quot;work the world&quot; with JT65A on HF -- even with low power, 
makeshift antennas, and poor (i.e., near-dead) band 
conditions.  After all, it was designed for use with 
extremely weak signals!
