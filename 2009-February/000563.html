<PRE>Hello all.

I've been working for quite some time to come to an understanding of WSJT at
a source code level.  It's been a long-long difficult process for me, but I
have finally made some progress and would like to share some of my hard
earned knowledge in case it might be of any interest to the group.  I also
want to provide a trail to my source tree where I hold the modified files
from WSJT which I have worked into a (very) crude DLL which I am using in my
own implementation of software to receive/transmit JT65A and support my RB
system.  Details can be found at <A HREF="http://www.w6cqz.org/">http://www.w6cqz.org/</A> in reference to the
program I'm working on and why I feel it may have some use to a very
specific segment of WSJT users, namely those of us who operate on HF and
contribute data to/use data from the RB spotting network.

In reference to the shared library.  I have built and successfully used a
dll containing the routines necessary for decoding/encoding JT65.  The
library as implemented is exceedingly crude and will need much cleanup to
represent anything other than a hack, but, it works. :)  I have attempted to
extract only the functions necessary to process signals leaving display,
timing and other necessary tasks to be implemented in the library's calling
program.  As an example, the program I'm currently working on implements
everything possible in its native code only using (what I call) libWSJT.dll
for the actual encoding/decoding of JT65 messages.  As of this writing I
have been running my program for several weeks to validate not only its
function, but also the library function and the results have been most
encouraging.  I have also built the shared library under Linux using an
Ubuntu 8 series base and it seems to be workable there, but I have yet to do
any extensive testing beyond a simple compile, link and ability to call a
routine test.  The program I'm creating is written in Free Pascal + Lazarus
GUI RAD and was picked due to my fondness for Pascal and FPC+Lazarus's
support for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X with minimal modifications between
specific platforms.

In any case, if anyone has interest in what I've done the source is
available at;

<A HREF="http://code.google.com/p/w6cqz-hf-wsjt/source/browse/#svn/JT65-HF">http://code.google.com/p/w6cqz-hf-wsjt/source/browse/#svn/JT65-HF</A>

The shared library code is in, obviously enough, the libWSJT folder.
