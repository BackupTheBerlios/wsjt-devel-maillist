<PRE>Dear WSJT colleagues,

About three weeks ago, HB9DRV asked on this list whether 
anyone had used the GNU compilers or g95 to compile WSJT for 
Windows.  I replied that the answer (as far as I was aware) 
was probably NO.

As you will have noticed from traffic on the WSJT-SVN list, 
I've been working on enhancements to MAP65 (a &quot;big brother&quot; 
program, stored in the Berlios repository as a branch from 
the WSJT code).  Recently I upgraded to a new station 
computer, and I took that to be a good opportunity to 
attempt a switch to using all open-source development tools.

I'm happy to report that MAP65 now runs well under Win/XP 
after being compiled with the help of MinGW, Msys, and the 
g95 Fortran compiler.

I expect to be unusually busy with QRL matters over the next 
several weeks, so it may not be until mid-December that I 
make necessary changes to the Windows makefile, etc., so 
that WSJT can also be compiled with free tools under 
Windows.  However, I want to make it known that it can be 
done ... and that actually it is quite straightforward.

A desirable side effect of the switchover to free 
development tools will be that Windows and *nix source code 
will be much more nearly identical.  The need for many
&quot;#ifdef Win32&quot; compile-time conditionals should disappear 
from our code base.

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
