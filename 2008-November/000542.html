<PRE>Joe and the list...
- WSPR 1.1 now running for quite some time here. Did not see any problem...

The following are suggestions for future improvements

1- Personaly I would like to have a &quot;sked&quot; mode (50% transmit rate, with 
the choice of the period 1st/2nd). That would allow to better analyze 
short openings, such as 80/160 antipodal grayline openings...

2- I still feel that some soundcard &quot;sample rate&quot; correction should be 
made possible to get the optimum decoding capability. This feature 
exists on digital terminals such as mixW and MMTTY. On a few digi-modes 
like Olivia, a careful adjustement makes a big difference (but even on 
PSK31 and TTY it makes a diffrence on signals near the decoding threshold).
The a/m software use a visual method (the SSTV terminal for mixW). You 
just tune on a &quot;time signal&quot; and you get the lines produced by the time 
signal as vertical as possible...  once the lines are perfectly 
vertical, you just press record and that's it...
Actualy WSPR does not need to include such visual terminal, but just a 
way of setting the &quot;sample rate correction&quot; once measured with another 
software.

3- I feel that many WSPR users are overdriving their soundcard input, 
which generates &quot;false decodes&quot;  . I think than a  &quot;optimum audio 
level&quot;  indicator should  be made available  within WSPR software  
(something similar  to the WSJT audio indicator)
 
That's all for the moment and thanks for your work.
Patrick
