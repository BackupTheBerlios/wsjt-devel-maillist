<PRE>Hi Joe,
re sampling rate-correction, a little addendum:
Something I noticed, is that feeding the same RX audio to 2 PC's I could 
see differences
I made a post about it, some time ago on the WSPRnet forum 
<A HREF="http://wsprnet.org/drupal/node/139">http://wsprnet.org/drupal/node/139</A>
for example:
PC1: 080924 1018 16 -19 1.5 10.140110 OK1DST JN79 33 0 2 0
PC2: 080924 1018 11 -23 1.4 10.140110 OK1DST JN79 33 0 1 0
PC1 080924 1032 29 -4 1.1 10.140147 EB1APK IN73 40 0 1 0
PC2 080924 1032 24 -8 1.1 10.140147 EB1APK IN73 40 0 1 0

The PC1 uses a microham USB-sound device, while the PC2 is an IBM 
&quot;thinkpad&quot; laptop
Last but not least: As already mentionned, I cannot get WSPR working on 
my desktop soundcard (while I' ve been using WSJT on it successfully at 
the beginning of JT6 )

Another point I forgot to mention:
The WSPR displayed DT, seems to have 1s offset:
- using my 2 stations sync on the same clock through dimension4 I see a 
constant DT+1 (or 0.9 to 1.1)
- I see the same DT +1 on a large majority of stations
I see the same, when time synchronized manually using a DCF77 clock or a 
GPS (when I don't have Internet access)
When I operate JT65, I see DT 0, most of the time...
But I am sure you  noticed it...

PS There are a few new things on my blog: The last one is an experience 
I did this morning on your 80m signal using 2 antennas; a K9AY in your 
direction, and my magnetic-loop turned 90 degrees away from you... Just 
after sunrise, despite the loop orientation, you got a few dB's stronger 
on the mag-loop, which seems to validate the hypothesis of a high-angle 
propagation mode  ( 60 degrees or higher) on the grayline. I just saw 
the same thing at sunset on T61AA signal...

&gt;<i> Hi Pat,
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - WSPR 1.1 now running for quite some time here. Did not see any 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> problem...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Experience here is the same. I will prepare an open release, probably 
</I>&gt;<i> next week.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The following are suggestions for future improvements
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1- Personaly I would like to have a &quot;sked&quot; mode (50% transmit rate, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> with the choice of the period 1st/2nd). That would allow to better 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> analyze short openings, such as 80/160 antipodal grayline openings...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Sounds like a reasonable idea.  I'll think about it for a future release.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2- I still feel that some soundcard &quot;sample rate&quot; correction should 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> be made possible to get the optimum decoding capability. This feature 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> exists on digital terminals such as mixW and MMTTY. On a few 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> digi-modes like Olivia, a careful adjustement makes a big difference 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (but even on PSK31 and TTY it makes a diffrence on signals near the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decoding threshold).
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> The a/m software use a visual method (the SSTV terminal for mixW). 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> You just tune on a &quot;time signal&quot; and you get the lines produced by 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the time signal as vertical as possible...  once the lines are 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> perfectly vertical, you just press record and that's it...
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Actualy WSPR does not need to include such visual terminal, but just 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a way of setting the &quot;sample rate correction&quot; once measured with 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> another software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My experience is that WSJT needs sample-rate correction on some 
</I>&gt;<i> computers because their sound hardware always samples at 48 kHz, and 
</I>&gt;<i> the software driver does a poor job of resampling to yield the 11025 
</I>&gt;<i> Hz samples required by WSJT.  To get around this problem, WSPR asks 
</I>&gt;<i> for samples at 12000 Hz.  I have yet to see a computer that produces 
</I>&gt;<i> significant (say, 0.1% or larger) sample-rate errors when the 
</I>&gt;<i> requested rate is 12000 Hz.  If you (or anyone else) can document 
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise, I would like to hear more about it.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 3- I feel that many WSPR users are overdriving their soundcard input, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> which generates &quot;false decodes&quot;  . I think than a  &quot;optimum audio 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> level&quot;  indicator should  be made available  within WSPR software  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> (something similar  to the WSJT audio indicator)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Obviously this would be a nice feature.  It has been on my &quot;to do&quot; 
</I>&gt;<i> list,  and still is.  In the meantime, just start up WSJT, hit 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;Monitor&quot;, and set the audio level level to &quot;0 dB&quot; there.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     -- 73, Joe, K1JT
