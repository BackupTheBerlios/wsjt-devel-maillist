<PRE>Hi Pat,

Thanks for your input.

Experience here is the same. I will prepare an open release, probably 
next week.

&gt;<i> The following are suggestions for future improvements
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 1- Personaly I would like to have a &quot;sked&quot; mode (50% transmit rate, with 
</I>&gt;<i> the choice of the period 1st/2nd). That would allow to better analyze 
</I>&gt;<i> short openings, such as 80/160 antipodal grayline openings...
</I>
Sounds like a reasonable idea.  I'll think about it for a future release.

&gt;<i> 2- I still feel that some soundcard &quot;sample rate&quot; correction should be 
</I>&gt;<i> made possible to get the optimum decoding capability. This feature 
</I>&gt;<i> exists on digital terminals such as mixW and MMTTY. On a few digi-modes 
</I>&gt;<i> like Olivia, a careful adjustement makes a big difference (but even on 
</I>&gt;<i> PSK31 and TTY it makes a diffrence on signals near the decoding threshold).
</I>&gt;<i> The a/m software use a visual method (the SSTV terminal for mixW). You 
</I>&gt;<i> just tune on a &quot;time signal&quot; and you get the lines produced by the time 
</I>&gt;<i> signal as vertical as possible...  once the lines are perfectly 
</I>&gt;<i> vertical, you just press record and that's it...
</I>&gt;<i> Actualy WSPR does not need to include such visual terminal, but just a 
</I>&gt;<i> way of setting the &quot;sample rate correction&quot; once measured with another 
</I>&gt;<i> software.
</I>
My experience is that WSJT needs sample-rate correction on some 
computers because their sound hardware always samples at 48 kHz, and the 
software driver does a poor job of resampling to yield the 11025 Hz 
samples required by WSJT.  To get around this problem, WSPR asks for 
samples at 12000 Hz.  I have yet to see a computer that produces 
significant (say, 0.1% or larger) sample-rate errors when the requested 
rate is 12000 Hz.  If you (or anyone else) can document otherwise, I 
would like to hear more about it.

&gt;<i> 3- I feel that many WSPR users are overdriving their soundcard input, 
</I>&gt;<i> which generates &quot;false decodes&quot;  . I think than a  &quot;optimum audio 
</I>&gt;<i> level&quot;  indicator should  be made available  within WSPR software  
</I>&gt;<i> (something similar  to the WSJT audio indicator)
</I>
Obviously this would be a nice feature.  It has been on my &quot;to do&quot; list, 
  and still is.  In the meantime, just start up WSJT, hit &quot;Monitor&quot;, and 
set the audio level level to &quot;0 dB&quot; there.
