<PRE>Hi Harry,

Thanks for sharing your thoughts on PSK.  I am wee aware of 
all of the characteristics of PSK that you mention.

1. Unlike PSK31, the PSK in JT2 is &quot;nearly constant 
envelope&quot; -- which is another way of saying that the 
transmitted bandwidth has been limited, but not nearly so 
severely (relative to the keying rate) as is done in PSK31. 
  Since the keying rate is less than 1/7 of that used in 
PSK31, this still means that the transmitted bandwidth is 
quite narrow.

2. Amplifier linearity requirements: I believe that the vast 
majority of WSJT operators use the same amplifier for WSJT 
modes as they use for SSB.

3. I emphasize, once again, that JT2 and JT4 are 
*EXPERIMENTAL* modes.  If they do not work out well, for 
whatever reason, they will not become permanent parts of WSJT.

4. Under the assumption that JT2 *does* become part of a 
released version of WSJT: anyone who has TVI problems with 
JT2 can decide not to use it.  FSK441, JT6M, JT65, and the 
other new mode, JT4, all generate continuous-phase, 
constant-amplitude waveforms.

5. If I had not had the benefit of on-the-air testing of 
FSK441, JT44, JT6M, and JT65 long before they were released 
for general use, there would be *no* WSJT modes today.
