<PRE>Dear Colleagues,

Here's an updated status report on the experimental modes 
JT2 and JT4 in WSJT:

I have now exchanged and recorded many transmissions in 
over-the-air tests using these modes.  JT2 was used with 
W6CQZ on the 30 m band, and JT2, JT4A, and JT4B have been 
used with DF2ZC via EME on 2 meters.  Many error-free 
decodings have been obtained with all of the mode/band 
combinations tried.  The first JT4A QSO (via EME, with 
DF2ZC) was of &quot;Ragchew&quot; quality, with 100% copy at each end.

You will recall that JT2 uses 2FSK modulation and DBPSK 
modulation for the encoded user information.  In this way it 
is able to send both a sync bit and a data bit in each 
channel symbol.  JT4 uses 4FSK modulation, and also sends a 
sync bit and data bit in each symbol.  Both JT2 and JT4 use 
the same message structure as JT65.

In a very few words, the tests so far show that:

1. JT2 works, but to be competitive with JT65 it needs 
either better phase stability than I have observed on the 
paths in question, or a better phase tracking algorithm than 
I have so far implemented.  Further effort is warranted, but 
at present JT2 is frustrating to use because seemingly 
adequate transmissions too often fail to decode.

2. JT4 works extremely well.  Early tests with the WSJT 
simulator show that its S/N performance is the same as JT65B 
(to within about 0.5 dB uncertainty).

Averaging over successive transmissions and &quot;deep search&quot; 
decoding have not yet been implemented in either JT2 or JT4.

For testing purposes I have specified 7 submodes of JT4, 
namely JT4A through JT4G.  The only difference in the 
generated signals is the separation between tones and the 
total occupied bandwidth, which are as follows (numbers are 
in Hz):

JT4   Spacing   BW
-------------------
  A     4.375   17.5
  B     8.75    35.0
  C    17.5     70.0
  D    39.375  157.5
  E    78.75   315.0
  F   157.5    630.0
  G   315.0   1260.0

I hope in the near future to have some tests made using JT4 
for 10 GHz EME.

A compiled and packaged version of WSJT 5.9.7 r550 with the 
above features has been placed at

<A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT597r550.EXE">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT597r550.EXE</A>

as an aid to making further tests.  Of course, you can also 
compile the latest code for either Windows of *nix from the 
SVN repository.

As always, comments, suggestions, and reports of any tests 
will be very welcome!

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
