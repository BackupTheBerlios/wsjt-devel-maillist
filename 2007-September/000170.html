<PRE>Dear Colleagues,

No doubt you have noticed the recent flurry of &quot;commits&quot; to 
the WSJT repository.  I should bring you up-to-date on 
what's happening.

I have been playing with two experimental new modes for WSJT 
called JT2 and JT4.  JT2 is a possible replacement for 
JT65A/B, for use at HF through 144 MHz.  JT4 is a possible 
replacement for modes JT65B/C, intended for EME at 432 MHz 
through 10 GHz and also for rainscatter at 10 GHz.  I 
emphasize that both are presently experimental; if they 
don't work out well, they will not become permanent parts of 
WSJT.

The basic specs are as follows:

JT2 uses 72-bit messages with the same message structure and 
source encoding as in JT65.  Instead of 64-tone FSK for the 
data and one additional tone for sync (as in JT65), JT2 uses 
2-tone FSK for the sync and binary PSK for the data.  A 
long-constraint convolutional code (K=32, r=1/2) augments 
the 72 user information bits to a total of 207 channel 
symbols.  The keying rate and FSK tone separation are 4.375 
Hz, so a transmission takes 207/4.375 = 47.3 seconds, nearly 
the same as for JT65.

On reception, sync is established by using noncoherent 
detection of the FSK information.  The synchronizing 
frequency offsets are then removed, and differential PSK 
techniques are used to convert the encoded data to soft 
channel symbols.  Finally, a sequential decoder using the 
Fano algorithm decodes the user message.

JT4 uses 4-tone FSK modulation to convey both a sync bit and 
a data bit in each channel symbol, following the suggestion 
made by Stewart Nelson nearly two years ago.  The sync 
pattern and the encoding/decoding of user information are 
the same as those used in JT2, except that noncoherent FSK 
detection methods are used for data as well as sync. 
Distinct submodes (JT4A, JT4B, ...) will use tone spacings 
from a minimum of 4.375 Hz up to a maximum of perhaps 315 Hz.

Some possible advantages of JT2 and JT4 relative to JT65 are 
as follows:

JT2 has a very narrow total bandwidth, just 8.75 Hz.   The 
WSJT simulator shows it to have a S/N performance about 
equal to JT65B, or perhaps slightly better.  Its narrow 
bandwidth could be a big advantage -- especially for random 
operation -- because 100 or more JT2 signals could easily 
fit into a transceiver's SSB bandwidth without mutual 
interference.  Some straightforward software enhancements 
could then give WSJT many of the remarkable capabilities 
that MAP65 now provides for JT65, including the decoding of 
all of JT2 signals in the receiver passband (perhaps 2.5 to 
5 kHz).  JT2 could be a very attractive and useful mode at 
HF through 144 MHz.  If activity were concentrated in a few 
5 kHz band segments, random operation could become easy for 
all 144 MHz EME operators.  The main uncertainty in my mind 
is whether 2-meter EME signals will have adequate phase 
stability to make PSK modulation effective on that path. 
This needs to be tested.

At 432 MHz and higher frequencies, differentially 
demodulated PSK will most likely fail ... and then JT4 may 
be an attractive alternative.  The JT4 tone separation can 
be as low as 4.375 Hz, making the total bandwidth 17.5 Hz: 
about 1/10 the bandwidth of JT65A, or 1/20 of JT65B.  Larger 
tone separations will be needed at microwave frequencies; I 
believe something like 150 Hz should be adequate for 10 GHz 
EME.   The S/N performance of JT4 may be 2 or 3 dB worse 
than JT65B/C under ideal conditions on the lower UHF bands, 
but on real EME paths -- especially at 1296 MHz and above -- 
JT4 may actually be better than JT65.  At 10 GHz no present 
WSJT mode can be used for EME, because libration-induced and 
differential Doppler shifts broaden the reflected signals by 
much more that the JT65C tone spacing.  With its wider 
spacings JT4 should be effective there and it can provide 
significant gain over CW.  JT4 should also work well for 
rain scatter.

Anyway, those are the basic facts and my present ideas ...

WSJT r537 has implemented JT2 for both Tx and Rx and JT4 for 
Tx only.  I will probably try some on-the-air tests before 
proceeding much further.

As always, comments and suggestions will be very welcome!

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
