<PRE>Here's a brief update on the state of the experimental modes 
JT2 and JT4.

The first JT2 QSO was made last Saturday evening, between 
K1JT and W6CQZ on 10.139 MHz.

Last night I ran tests on 144 MHz EME with DF2ZC.  We copied 
about half of the relevant JT2 transmissions in each 
direction, and we also recorded a number of transmissions in 
the JT4A and JT4B modes.  (A decoder has not yet been 
written for the JT4 modes, so there was no real-time copy of 
these.)  Synchronization performance was very good in both 
JT2 and JT4 modes.

JT65B provides perfect copy at signal levels well below 
those between DF2ZC and K1JT last night, so in S/N terms the 
JT2 performance was not very good.  However, the test 
establishes that PSK modulation is not out of the question 
for use on the EME path at 2 meters.  It will be necessary 
now to carefully examine the causes of all the decoding 
failures.  The present JT2 decoder is unsophisticated in 
many ways, and it may be possible to improve its performance 
significantly.

A decoder has still to be written for JT4 signals.  These 
modes may be useful additions to WSJT even if JT2 is not, 
because they may perform well on paths where Doppler 
spreading is larger than the JT65C tone spacing -- for 
example, EME and rain scatter at 10 GHz.

I have some very busy weeks coming up, so progress will 
necessarily slow down a bit.

     -- 73, Joe, K1JT
