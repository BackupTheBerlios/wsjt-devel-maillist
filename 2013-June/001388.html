<PRE>Hi John,

I have no idea why these non-repeatable things are happening.  Hope you 
will be able to isolate the cause(s).

&gt;<i> 3. The kvasd executable is not open source, so it is not acceptable to
</I>&gt;<i> Debian, so I am running without it.
</I>
Yes.  Perhaps a Debian-approved package might include a note with brief 
instructions on how to download the kvasd executable from my web site 
and install it.

</I>
You have the same permissions as everyone else in the developers group, 
so you should be able to commit to the repository.  What was the error 
message, exactly?

Meanwhile, I will insert this code.

&gt;<i> 4. I am not seeing any signals in the waterfall, when I have the
</I>&gt;<i> correct sound card selected. In the mainwindow, the slider is set so
</I>&gt;<i> that the thermometer is mid-scale &amp; ~-30dB when no signals are
</I>&gt;<i> present. I do see signals in the waterfall, when the wrong sound input
</I>&gt;<i> is selected, i.e. the mic on the laptop, hearing the noise in the
</I>&gt;<i> shack. Last week, I was seeing signals in the waterfall, with the
</I>&gt;<i> correct sound input, although I had to set Zero=-29 (see attached
</I>&gt;<i> picture), and even then, the background was not as bright as expected.
</I>&gt;<i> Decoding works, even though the waterfall does not show data, and the
</I>&gt;<i> waterfall in old version r3348 still works correctly. I note that when
</I>&gt;<i> the correct sound input is selected, the slider must be at ~85% to get
</I>&gt;<i> -30 dB noise level; when the wrong (mic) input is selected, the slider
</I>&gt;<i> must be moved to ~20% to get -30 dB noise level.
</I>
Again, I don't understand the reason for these anomalies.  Sound input 
seems to work as expected here, in both Win7 and Linux.

I do notice that I had to turn the alsamixer gain control very low to 
get the expected levels... I don't know the reason for this.

&gt;<i> 5. Last week, I widened the width of the waterfall widgets, and I see
</I>&gt;<i> that you also changed it to approximately what I had. Your new widths
</I>&gt;<i> now look OK on my system.
</I>
Good.  They look OK here, too.

&gt;<i> 6. I bought a 6 kHz wide IF filter for my Elecraft K3, but I find the
</I>&gt;<i> bandwidth is still restricted to 4.2 kHz when the K3 is in MODE=DATA.
</I>&gt;<i> This is a hard limit in the audio path of the K3.
</I>
I suspect that something similar is true of other radios.  My TS-2000 
drops off rather quickly above 4 kHz, even when &quot;Hi Cut&quot; is set to 5 kHz.
