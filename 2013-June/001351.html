<PRE>To:   Users and potential users of WSJT-X
From: Joe Taylor, K1JT

You may be interested in what's coming in a yet-to-be-released version 
of WSJT-X.

For those with transceivers that can support it, the maximum displayed 
bandwidth has been increased from 1 kHz to 5 kHz.  My TS-2000 is a good 
example of this capability: it works well at 4 kHz bandwidth.  That's 
enough so that I can set the dial frequency to 14.076 and see 
essentially all the 20m activity on both JT65 and JT9.

An example of the resulting waterfall display is posted at
<A HREF="http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx_1.1a.png">http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx_1.1a.png</A> .
On the scale shown, JT65 activity is found in the approximate range 300 
to 2300 Hz, JT9 activity from 3000 to 4000 Hz.  The JT65 decoder has 
been ported from MAP65 and is working well as a stand-alone program, 
using data recorded by WSJT-X.  The JT65 decoder is ready to be 
integrated into WSJT-X.

My plan is to allow the operator to choose JT9 or JT65 decoding, or 
both.  If you choose both, all messages will appear on screen.  The mode 
will be indicated with a single-character flag, or perhaps a distinct 
color, or some such scheme.  If you double-click on a JT9 message, 
you'll transmit JT9.  If it's a JT65 message, you'll transmit JT65.

One advantage of the dual-mode scheme is that more operators can start 
to get a feel for the relative merits of the two modes.  In particular, 
it will be very obvious that JT9 has essentially the same (actually 
about 2 dB better) sensitivity, while requiring less than 10% of the 
bandwidth.  That means ten times as many stations will fit into each kHz 
of spectrum!

Many details of the implementation are yet to be worked out. 
Suggestions and comments on these plans will be welcome.
