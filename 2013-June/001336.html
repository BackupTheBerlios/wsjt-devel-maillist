<PRE>Hi David,

Thanks for the report.

I know there are some issues with JT9-2 (as there were, also, with the 
-5, -10, and -30 submodes), but I don't consider it a high priority to 
work on those problems.

Those submodes were intended for experimentation at MF and LF.  Their 
tone spacings are too small for them to work well with the Doppler 
spreads and oscillator stabilities typical on the HF bands.  Moreover, 
the T/R sequences are too slow (read &quot;boring&quot;) for most people to find 
them attractive to use, most of the time.

After all, JT9-2 offers a 3 dB advantage at best.  You can often 
overcome a 3 dB shortfall simply by turning up the power (say, from 5 W 
to 10 W), or waiting for QSB to bring the signal up by a bit.  Even with 
that wait, you may finish the QSO sooner than you would with one of the 
slower submodes.

We have plenty of experience with these issues with JT modes used for 
EME at VHF and UHF.  T/R sequences longer than one minute have never 
been popular.  JT65 offers the ability to average several successive 
transmissions, which works well when another 2-4 dB is needed to make a 
QSO.  In principle such capability could be programmed for JT9, as well, 
although I have no plans to do so at present.

Bottom line: unless and until someone offers a persuasive argument that 
JT9-2 (or a slower submode) has an important application and would see 
significant use, I'm not planning to spend more time on it.
