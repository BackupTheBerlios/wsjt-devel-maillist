<PRE>Hi John,

I'm copying this to wsjt-devel so others can see what we're discussing. 
  Perhaps we'll get some other comments or advice.

</I>
I made several dozen JT65 QSOs yesterday.  As you say, it works well.  A 
few rough edges, I'll soon turn to polishing things up a bit.

&gt;<i> One thing I notice is that with fmin/fmax = 300/3000,  JT65 only

</I>&gt;<i> but also JT65.    Am I right that fmin/fmax sets a decode only window?
</I>
The present code uses fmin/fmax only for JT9, setting the decode range 
for that mode.  The JT65 decode range is presently hard-wired at 
500-2500 Hz in these lines near the top of jt65a.f90:

         fa=500.0
         fb=2500.0

Probably these should be changed to something more like

         fa=200.0
         fb=2700.0

Another possibility would be to remove the fmin/fmax controls and just 
use the displayed upper frequency limit of the waterfall (call it fmax); 
then let both decoders cover the whole range from 200 Hz to fmax.

Or maybe have a single spinner control to set a JT65/JT9 dividing line: 
decode JT65 below that point, JT9 above.  I'll have to see what the 
decoder speed penalties might be.

&gt;<i> Now what I need is rigctl to set XIT on or off on my TS870 as needed
</I>&gt;<i> so that I can control everything using a VNC app on my ipad so I
</I>&gt;<i> don't have to sit in the shack!!
</I>
Me, too!!  I hope to implement XIT control today.

JT65 signal reports pose some issues.  The original JT65 message-packing 
algorithm supported -30 &lt;= SNR &lt;= -01 dB.  This was fine for EME, where 
no signals are stronger than around -10.

Calculation of SNR in the JT65 decoder has traditionally been nonlinear 
above -15 dB or so: values are compressed so that very strong signals 
seldom (if ever) come out above -1, but anything in the -1 to -10 range 
is actually close to meaningless.

JT9 is much better at maintaining linearity of the dB scale, and the 
message-packing algorithm now supports reports anywhere in the range -50 
to +49 dB.  (This meant sacrificing the ability to convey some grid 
locators within 2 degrees of the south pole, which I considered 
acceptable.)  We could implement a linear scale for JT65, too, and allow 
signal reports of 0-49 dB -- perhaps helpful, to advise people when 
they're using much more power than required -- but until everyone starts 
using WSJT-X, users of older versions of WSJT, JT65-HF, etc., will see 
those signal reports displayed as grid locators near the south pole. 
Not desirable!

I guess we could have a user option &quot;Allow expanded signal reports&quot;, 
with the default being OFF -- and suitable warnings in the User's Guide.
