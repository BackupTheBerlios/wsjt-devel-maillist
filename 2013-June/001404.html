<PRE>Hi Edson,

Thanks for reporting your findings with v1.1.

&gt;<i> I could compile v1.1 on my system after a small change in the Qt project
</I>&gt;<i> file to point the path for the lib directory referenced from the current
</I>&gt;<i> directory instead of ../wsjtx/lib (which is not the directory created by
</I>&gt;<i> SVN for v1.1).
</I>
Yes, the directory structure of the wsjt_k1jt_p1 branch is a bit 
convoluted.  Another good reason to merge its code back into the main 
wsjtx branch, as soon as it's stable enough.

&gt;<i> I am however having operational issues. I am unable to see the complete JT9
</I>&gt;<i> spectrum. The spectrogram window would need to be 1.5 times larger than the
</I>&gt;<i> width of my monitor. I can, of course, compress the screen using a higher
</I>&gt;<i> FFT bin/pixel, but this makes the signals look quite narrow and difficult
</I>&gt;<i> to identify and tune.  May be I am not operating the spectrum correctly? Is
</I>&gt;<i> there a way to set the lowest frequency?
</I>
What's your screen resolution?  On a 1440x900 monitor the display seems 
good to me.  More is better, especially if you want to use the wider 
bandwidths made possible by v1.1.  Less is usable, but certainly less 
desirable.

I don't find tuning difficult at Bins/Pixel = 4 or even 5, and it seems 
to me that both JT65 and JT9 signals are easily dealth with at that 
resolution.  Since the program finds signals automatically, anyway, 
there's not much &quot;tuning&quot; to do, by hand.

The low-frequency limit of displayed spectrum is currently fixed at 
zero.  My thinking was that the filters in most radios go down to 500 Hz 
and maybe lower, so not much space could be saved by starting at a 
higher value.

&gt;<i> I also find confusing and
</I>&gt;<i> distracting to have JT65 signals on the same window as JT9, but is jut my
</I>&gt;<i> personal opinion.
</I>
Of course there's no need to have both modes in the displayed window. 
Users with max BW in the 2.4 to 2.7 kHz range, especially, may want to 
concentrate on one mode or the other.

One motivation for making it possible to have both modes available at 
once is that it should help people to see that at most about 10 JT65 
signals can fit into the range displayed by JT65-HF without overlap, 
while more like 120 JT9 signals could do so.

&gt;&gt;<i> You may notice that for Windows I'm still using the Windows-only interface
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to pskReporter.  The reason is that its messages include antenna
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> information (m_pskAntenna in mainwindow.cpp), which users have asked for.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I will look into this. I will also make the new pskreporter interface
</I>&gt;<i> active for both Linux and WIndows.
</I>
Great!

&gt;&gt;<i> Did you make any progress toward a &quot;Thermo&quot; replacement, any better than
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the adapted ProgressBar that I'm using now?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I did some work on it, but I put it on hold waiting for the Qt5 migration
</I>&gt;<i> as I though the plan was to remove the dependency on Qwt when we migrate
</I>&gt;<i> the code base to Qt5 and review the user interface layout. If we are
</I>&gt;<i> staying with Qt4 and the current GUI layout for a while, I am happy to
</I>&gt;<i> finish the widget.
</I>
I thought it best to have code that we can compile with either Qt4 or 
Qt5, to ease the transition.  So when you can find time, it will be good 
to have the new widget.  No big rush, though!
