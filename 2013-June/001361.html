<PRE>Hi Lance,

</I>
What's the basis for your assertion that MAP65 is &quot;a couple dB less 
sensitive than the highly optimized decoder in WSJT&quot;?  Or your 
implication that the decoder in MAP65 is any less highly optimized?

Such impressions have never stood up to close examination.

Of course I've made exhaustive comparisons among the various decoding 
algorithms and their implementation myself -- many times.  I will be 
doing so again with the JT65 decoder in WSJT-X.

For a wholly independent look at the question by W3SZ, see the detailed 
experiment and analysis on his web site:
<A HREF="http://www.nitehawk.com/w3sz/LinradMAP65Statistics.htm">http://www.nitehawk.com/w3sz/LinradMAP65Statistics.htm</A>

The bottom-line conclusion from W3SZ:

&quot;The MAP65 Decoder on same frequency as the WSJT Decoder at same time as
the WSJT Decoder decoded about 10% of messages WSJT did not, and WSJT
decoded about 10% of messages that MAP65 did not.&quot;

The W3SZ test was based on observations of EME signals on 144 MHz, made 
during the 2013 ARRL EME Contest.  I have demonstrated the same thing, 
to my own satisfaction, in a laboratory setting.  It's good to see that 
real-world results are fully consistent with expectations.
