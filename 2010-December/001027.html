<PRE>If you have been testing WSPR 2.2 with its frequency-hopping, feature, 
please upgrade to revision 2283.  Direct links for download are:

Windows:
<A HREF="http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR2.20_r2283.EXE">http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR2.20_r2283.EXE</A>

Linux:
<A HREF="http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wspr_2.20r2283_i386.deb">http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wspr_2.20r2283_i386.deb</A>

This version has several new features:

1. A checkbox labeled &quot;Coordinated bands&quot; is now available at the bottom 
of WSPR's Frequency Hopping screen.  If this box is checked, the 
first-choice selected band will be determined by the UTC minute at which 
a 2-minute sequence starts:

  UTC   Band
Minute  (m)
----------------
00      160
02       80
04       60
06       40
08       30
10       20
12       17
14       15
16       12
18       10

20      160
22       80
... etc

The sequence of ten possible bands repeats three times each hour.  If 
the first choice band has not been checked as an active band, a random 
band choice is made among those that are active.

Decision whether to receive or transmit is purely random, using the Tx 
fraction for the selected band.

If all WSPR stations using frequency hopping use the &quot;Coordinated bands&quot; 
option, a sizable group of will move together from band to band.  During 
any particular sequence, something like 20% of the stations (depending 
on their Tx fraction settings) will transmit, and the rest will receive. 
  The average number of spots will be much larger than that if band 
selection is random.  If a band gets too crowded -- say, if you often 
see more than 6-8 stations in one sequence -- you should probably reduce 
your Tx fraction for that band.

2. There is now an &quot;ATU tuneup&quot; feature.  When WSPR hops to a new band, 
if the &quot;Tuneup&quot; box for that band is checked the program will transmit a 
carrier for 4 seconds.  This should happen at about 115-119 s in the 
basic 120-second cycle.  The idea is that automatic ATU's would tune 
themselves during this time.  (It may turn out to be better to use a 
shorter tuneup interval, say 1 second, or to make the duration a user 
parameter.  Automatic ATU's with memory need only a very short signal.)

3. Frequency-hopping parameters are saved on program exit and restored 
when the program is restarted.  The information goes to a new file named 
&quot;hopping.ini&quot;.

As usual, user feedback is encouraged!

I have been running in this mode for the past few days, and will 
continue doing so this week.  Please give it a try, so we can have a 
significant number of stations moving together from band to band.
