<PRE>Hi Sivan,

I'm not sure that I understand exactly what you meant when saying that 
&quot;IQ decoding&quot; took 1.5 minutes on your slow machine.  Do you mean the 
call to iqdemod() alone takes that long?  If speed here is a major 
bottleneck, there are many ways to improve the computational efficiency. 
  [Little optimization of the algorithm was attempted, once I got it 
working, since it seemed plenty fast enough on a recent-vintage computer.]

The present iqdemod() begins by doing a complex FFT of length 
NFFT=5,760,000.  Downsampling from 48000 to 12000 Hz is accomplished by 
doing an inverse FFT (thus returning to the time domain) of length 
NFFT4=1,440,000=NFFT/4.

The long FFT alone requires some 46 MB of fast memory for data storage. 
  Big speed penalties will be felt on machines with not enough memory, 
or with relatively small level-1 cache.

There is no fundamental need to process the whole 2-minute data block in 
one go.  Breaking up the filtering and downsampling into smaller pieces 
would be much more efficient, especially on small-memory, slow-CPU 
machines.
