<PRE>John: Thanks for sharing the idea for the two different schedules.

Joe: thanks for cleaning up my code before releasing it.

How about the following hopping and t/r schedule? For hopping, we'll pick up
a random permutation of the active bands, go though it, then pick up another
random permutation, etc. If you hop on n bands, this means that the maximum
number of periods between visiting a given band is 2*n-1. For T/R, we can
pick a random integer between 1 and k to decide when to transmit on a band
on which the pctx is 1/k. Once the k cycles on that band are over, we pick
another integer for the next k, etc. This still means that we can transmit
twice in a row (we can fix that by picking from 2 to k the previous cycle
ended in Tx). We might still transmit twice in a row in two bands. If people
think it's reasonable I can simulate it.

Another idea: we can expand a bit Joe's user_hardware interface to allow
more complicated behaviors. More specifically, if a certain program/script
exists, we would call it with the band we want to hop to next (and perhaps a
bit more info), but unlike now, we would expect a more complex response. The
response could tell WSPR where to hop to (or more likely, that the script
already hopped), whether to transmit or receive, and what's the transmit
power. This would essentially allow people to design their own schedulers
that override WSPR's decision. They could also do things like cycle between
power levels (4Z4TJ suggested this to me in an email), make sure they listen
to beacons on specific bands in specific time slots (G4ZFQ suggested
something like this in the forum), etc. A TCP/IP connection is also a
possibility, and would be more efficient and somewhat simpler (because WSPR
wouldn't need to start a program every time, and because the other program
could keep state in memory).
