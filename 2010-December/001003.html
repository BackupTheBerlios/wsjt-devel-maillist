<PRE>Hi all,

A few minutes ago I posted the following message to WSPRnet.org and to 
the wsjtgroup reflector.

Subject: [wsjtgroup] WSPR 2.20: Frequency Hopping
Date: Wed, 01 Dec 2010 16:43:08 -0500
From: Joe Taylor &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/wsjt-devel">joe at Princeton.EDU</A>&gt;
To: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/wsjt-devel">wsjtgroup at yahoogroups.com</A>

You may have noticed that a few of us have been playing with a version
of WSPR that does automatic &quot;frequency hopping&quot; from band to band.  For
this we owe a big vote of thanks to Sivan Toledo, 4X6IZ, who wrote most
of the initial frequency-hoppping code.

If you would like to try WSPR with frequency hopping, a beta-release of
WSPR 2.20 is now available at

Windows:
<A HREF="http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR2.20_r2279.EXE">http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR2.20_r2279.EXE</A>

Linux:
<A HREF="http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wspr_2.20r2279_i386.deb">http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wspr_2.20r2279_i386.deb</A>

Select &quot;Frequency Hopping&quot; on the Seup menu, and you'll get a screen
allowing you to select any desired mix of bands and Tx fractions.  Then
check &quot;Frequency Hop&quot; in the main window, and WSPR will start its normal
2-minute sequences, switching bands randomly after each one.


Depending on your station and antenna setup, you might need to
accomplish other switching besides re-tuning your radio.  To make this
possible in an automated way, whenever WSPR executes a successful
band-change command to a CAT-controlled radio, it looks for a file named
&quot;user_hardware.bat&quot;, &quot;user_hardware.exe&quot;, or &quot;user_hardware&quot; in the
working directory.  If one of these is found, WSPR tries to execute the
command

user_hardware nnn

where nnn is the band-designation wavelength in meters.

You will need to write your own program, script, or batch file to do the
necessary switching at your station.  I wrote a very simple Python
program for this purpose.  One of my antennas is an &quot;all band&quot; dipole
fed with open-wire line through an automatic antenna tuner.  Others
include a 160m vertical and a tri-band trap dipole.  The antennas are
selected automatically, by band; and when a transmission on a new band
starts on the all-band diploe, the tuner adjusts itself during the first
few seconds of the transmission.


Many desirable features for a frequency-hopping WSPR are not yet
implemented.  It seems best to get some feedback from experienced users
before the following things (and surely many others) are added:

1. Save/Restore of one or more band-hopping setups.
2. Transmission of a short &quot;tune-up&quot; carrier, to be used by automatic
antenna tuners, just before starting a normal 2-minute sequence.
3. Possible changes in the algorithms that determine when to change
bands and when to transmit.  (At present, both are &quot;purely random&quot;.)
4. ...

As always, comments and suggestions are welcome!
