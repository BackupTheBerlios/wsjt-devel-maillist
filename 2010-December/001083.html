To use, copy WsprMod/w.pyd to WsprModNoGui (I am sure there's a way to avoid
this, probably by setting
PYTHONPATH or something like that). Now just run &quot;python -O wspr_nogui.py&quot;
instead of running wspr.py.

The code uses the same wspr.ini and hopping.ini, so running it should be
equivalent to starting up WSPR
and letting it run without touching the GUI.

I tested it in hopping and no-hopping modes, but RX only. Bugs typically
show up as remaining calls
to GUI functions.

This is just a prototype; it can't be supported this way. one way make this
maintainable is to refactor
the Python codes into a functional part (scheduling, reading files, etc) and
a control part. By refactoring i mean a clean separation of the GUI code
from the functional code. Right now they are intertwined in a complex way.
For example, update() does a lot of important functional things, but also
updates the GUI.

Once the program is refactored, we can support botha GUI controller and a
text-based controller. In general this refactoring is a good structural
change, but I doubt how many people will actually use the text-based GUI. A
possibly more useful controller might be a TCP/IP controller that allows you
to run WSPR on one machine but run the GUI on another machine, or through a
web browser, etc. Even this is a bit esoteric.

I can do the refactoring if there is interest. I will again do it in
separate files that can then replace the existing ones, rather than by
hacking away at wspr.py and the other GUI codes.
