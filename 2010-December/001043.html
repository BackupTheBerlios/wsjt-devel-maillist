<PRE>Hi Joe,

 &gt; Is there a program distribution format for OS X analogous to  
the .deb files for GNU/Linux?

This could be done.  But....

The problem lies with dependencies.    At some point, Mac users (and  
Linux too, I suppose) have to get/install:
python infrastructure including numpy; Imaging; portaudio; fftw3;  
samplerate  otherwise the program distribution will be useless.

Once these are in place, then the rest is easy, of course.    I  
imagine that all Linux users are accustomed to working at a system  
level and therefore do not have much of a problem in obtaining and  
installing these dependencies.    Compilers are part of the Linux  
package.

On the other hand, I guess most &quot;normal&quot; users of, say, a Windows PC,  
will know how to run Setup and install a package which is fully self- 
contained but would not have any idea about how to compile from  
source and probably would not have the necessary compiler and other  
tools in order to do so.   The same applies to a &quot;normal&quot; Mac user  
who may not even be aware that the subterranean architecture of their  
Mac is full-blown Unix.

I have successfully guided a few Mac people with minimal Unix  
experience through my HowTo and got them to install everything (WSJT  
and WSPR).    But it is not easy for a novice to do this without help.

Diane, you have a Mac (or several).....Comments?

John
