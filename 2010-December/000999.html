I think feedback would indeed be useful.

</I>&gt;<i> sequences, I probably want to Tx in the next sequence on this band.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I think that we need to separate this into two questions and to address each
one separately.

The first question is whether we need to give the user control over band
selection and T/R while WSPR is hopping, and if so, how. The scenario here
is a user that looks at the screen and does not like the fact that the radio
has not hopped to 20m in the last 10 minutes. I already wrote that I think
that this is a real concern and that we should perhaps address it by
allowing the user to say what the next band should be and what the next T/R
decision should be, without quitting hopping. We can also imagine longer
term control but I think it will just complicate things.

The second question is what we want to optimize during long hopping periods
in which the user is not constantly looking at the screen, and how to
optimize this metric. I think that this is basically an engineering question
(and a tractable one), rather than a user-experience question.

We can define the metric to optimize fairly simply: the expected number of
periods between two slots in which station 1 transmits on a band and station
2 receives on the same band. For the same expected value, we should prefer
the hopping strategy with the small standard deviation (the more regular
rendezvous). If both expectation and std dev are similar, we should prefer
the strategy that feels less random to the user.

I wrote a small simulation program (in Matlab) that lets two stations hop
under given band and pctx settings and computes these statistics (both ways,
1 hears 2 and 2 hears 1). I implemented 3 hopping schedules: (a) totally
random, (b) each station picks a random permutation of bands and cycles
through it, and (c) each station picks up a random permutation but replaces
it with another after going through it once. The T/R was totally random in
all cases (but I can enhance the program to model other T/R strategies). I
ran experiments in which each station hops on 5 bands, but with only 1 band
in common. One transmits on this band 10% or the time, the other 50%. I ran
it for 1M cycles (close to 4 years). The average periods in (a) and (c) were
quite similar, around 500 for hearing the 10% station and 55 periods for
hearing the 50% station. These correspond to about once every two hours and
once eveyr 16 hours. Strategy (c) was terrible; in most experiments they
never heard each other (because their 5-band cycles were misaligned), but in
the rest the averages were small, about 100 and 11.

My suggestion is to experiment with this simulation until we find a hopping
and T/R strategy that delivers good statistics  in reasonable scenarios (and
if possible, is relatively regular) and does not behave terribly in any
scenario, and then implement it in WSPR. I'll be happy to commit the code (~
100 lines) to SVN, and/or to port it from Matlab to Python if others want to
play with it too.
