<PRE>Hi Sivan and all,

Thanks for describing what you did for a command-line WSPR.  Very 
interesting approach!  Here are just a few initial comments...

&gt;<i> I'll appreciate any comments on this. I realize that not many people will
</I>&gt;<i> want it, and that if the group supports this mode, it will add maintenance
</I>&gt;<i> overhead whether we stick to separate files (which will need to be modified
</I>&gt;<i> when the main ones are) or integrate the no-hopping option into wspr.py.
</I>
I don't understand the last sentence.  Did you mean to write &quot;no-GUI 
option&quot;, rather than &quot;no-hopping option&quot;?

&gt;<i> The other thing I discovered is that the IQ decoding takes a minute and a
</I>&gt;<i> half on this machine, and the mept162 takes more than 30 seconds (I am not
</I>&gt;<i> sure how long, but more than 30 seconds). So it clearly can't receive and
</I>&gt;<i> decode all the 2-minute slots. I think that wspr2 is waiting for the decode
</I>&gt;<i> to end before the next cycle begins, but I assume that this is not something
</I>&gt;<i> that Joe planned for. Do you guys think that I'll simply get every second or
</I>&gt;<i> every third slot processed and the rest will not be received, or will I get
</I>&gt;<i> some garbage? I guess the reasonable thing is to get a machine that's a bit
</I>&gt;<i> faster.
</I>
The Fano (or &quot;sequential&quot;) algorithm used to decode WSPR's 
long-constraint convolutional code has the somewhat unusual behavior 
that decoding time is essentially unbounded.  If S/N is good and the 
number of &quot;raw&quot; errors small, decoding is very fast.  At low S/N the 
decoding can take almost &quot;forever&quot;, so the loop is configured to time 
out after a specified number of tries.  The timeout limit is defined by 
the statement

   l;imit=10000

in decode162.f.  You can make failures-to-decode ten times faster by 
setting limit=1000.  The cost will be that a few decodes that would have 
been successful with the longer limit will be lost.

You can see how many decoding cycles were required for each line of 
decoded text in ALL_WSPR.TXT.  After the decoded message there are three 
numbers; the second one is the number of decopding cycles.  You'll 
notice that a rather small fraction ate larger than 1000.

One further thought.  A significant motivation for wspr0, on my part, 
was to make the program easy to understand and modify.  In a sense, it 
serves as a documentation for the WSPR protocol.  For this reason I 
considered it important that it be written in one dominant language, in 
this case Fortran.  If there is significant demand for having IQ 
capability in wspr0, that would not be very hard to add.  The iqdemod 
and dual-channel sample routines are already present in the main wspr 
code base.
