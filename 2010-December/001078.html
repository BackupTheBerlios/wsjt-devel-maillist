&gt;<i> Hi Sivan and all,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for describing what you did for a command-line WSPR.  Very
</I>&gt;<i> interesting approach!  Here are just a few initial comments...
</I>

If you want, I can check them into SVN. These are separate files, so they
won't mess anything up and you can then compare them to the originals.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  I'll appreciate any comments on this. I realize that not many people will
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> want it, and that if the group supports this mode, it will add maintenance
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> overhead whether we stick to separate files (which will need to be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> modified
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> when the main ones are) or integrate the no-hopping option into wspr.py.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I don't understand the last sentence.  Did you mean to write &quot;no-GUI
</I>&gt;<i> option&quot;, rather than &quot;no-hopping option&quot;?
</I>

Yes, I meant no-gui. Sorry.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  The other thing I discovered is that the IQ decoding takes a minute and a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> half on this machine, and the mept162 takes more than 30 seconds (I am not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> sure how long, but more than 30 seconds). So it clearly can't receive and
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decode all the 2-minute slots. I think that wspr2 is waiting for the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> decode
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to end before the next cycle begins, but I assume that this is not
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> something
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that Joe planned for. Do you guys think that I'll simply get every second
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> every third slot processed and the rest will not be received, or will I
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> get
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> some garbage? I guess the reasonable thing is to get a machine that's a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> bit
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> faster.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The Fano (or &quot;sequential&quot;) algorithm used to decode WSPR's long-constraint
</I>&gt;<i> convolutional code has the somewhat unusual behavior that decoding time is
</I>&gt;<i> essentially unbounded.  If S/N is good and the number of &quot;raw&quot; errors small,
</I>&gt;<i> decoding is very fast.  At low S/N the decoding can take almost &quot;forever&quot;,
</I>&gt;<i> so the loop is configured to time out after a specified number of tries.
</I>&gt;<i>  The timeout limit is defined by the statement
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>  l;imit=10000
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> in decode162.f.  You can make failures-to-decode ten times faster by
</I>&gt;<i> setting limit=1000.  The cost will be that a few decodes that would have
</I>&gt;<i> been successful with the longer limit will be lost.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You can see how many decoding cycles were required for each line of decoded
</I>&gt;<i> text in ALL_WSPR.TXT.  After the decoded message there are three numbers;
</I>&gt;<i> the second one is the number of decopding cycles.  You'll notice that a
</I>&gt;<i> rather small fraction ate larger than 1000.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Thanks. I'm not sure it will be enough to make it fast enough to fit in 2
minutes given that just the IQ decoding takes 1.5 minutes, but I can give it
a try.


&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One further thought.  A significant motivation for wspr0, on my part, was
</I>&gt;<i> to make the program easy to understand and modify.  In a sense, it serves as
</I>&gt;<i> a documentation for the WSPR protocol.  For this reason I considered it
</I>&gt;<i> important that it be written in one dominant language, in this case Fortran.
</I>&gt;<i>  If there is significant demand for having IQ capability in wspr0, that
</I>&gt;<i> would not be very hard to add.  The iqdemod and dual-channel sample routines
</I>&gt;<i> are already present in the main wspr code base.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I agree that it's very useful to have this kind of reference code. I figured
it would not be difficult to add IQ capability, but the full WSPR has many
useful features that I do not want to give up, like hopping, timing the
RX/TX in the 2 minute slots, uploading spots. So for me it made more sense
to strip away the code that I did not want (GUI) than to build all the rest
on top of wspr0, even if wspr0 does the IQ demodulation.
