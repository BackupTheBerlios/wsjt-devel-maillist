<PRE>I'm trying to get WSPR to run on a slow hardware (an embedded PC with an x86
processor running at 266MHz) running Ubuntu Linux.

I installed the program and it opens its windows, but does not actually
paint them (no buttons appear). The process is running at close to 100% cpu.

If the problem turns out to be that each decoding each cycle takes more than
2 minutes, then either I can't run WSPR on this platform, or I'll have to
skip some cycles (I don't think I'll bother; I'll try some other platform).
But I suspect that perhaps the problem is not in the decode time but in
overhead somewhere else.

My actual goal is to not to run WSPR on this platform with the GUI, but in
command-line mode. I'm doing this because it's a low-power and fanless
computer that I can keep on all the time, running WSPR in receive mode.

I don't think it's a terribly important effort, but if somebody has an idea
on how to make it work, I'll be happy to hear.

Regards, Sivan
