<PRE>Hi Sivan,

&gt;<i> I think that the lock and unlock routines don't do anything currently. They
</I>&gt;<i> are implemented in cs_stubs.f90 as empty routines.
</I>
As John mentioned: WSPR uses thread-control routines in thnix.f90 
fthread.c.  These simple routines (which I wrote) are Fortran wrappers 
for the actual threading routines in the pthread library.

&gt;<i> As for John's question about my hardware: I am running WSPR on a fairly
</I>&gt;<i> recent laptop with an Intel Core i5 processor. But this may not say much. My
</I>&gt;<i> experience with Windows is that it sometimes lets an application linger for
</I>&gt;<i> a couple of seconds while another application is doing something. It's much
</I>&gt;<i> more severe than under Linux. Changing the process's priority in the task
</I>&gt;<i> manager helps tremendously. Perhaps I should try it with WSPR.
</I>
Up until revision 2142, some individual-thread priority control existed 
within WSPR -- at least when it was compiled on an older system I no 
longer have, using the &quot;Compaq Visual Fortran&quot; compiler.  Specifically, 
the Rx and Tx threads -- those started in startrx and starttx -- ran at 
&quot;ABOVE_NORMAL&quot; priority, the decoder thread ran at &quot;BELOW_NORMAL&quot;, and 
everything else at &quot;NORMAL&quot;.  That is not done now, and probably it 
should be.

	-- Joe
