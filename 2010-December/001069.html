<PRE>Hi Joe,

Two small suggestions for the 3.0 manual and GUI:

1. Rather than &quot;Reverse TX IQ&quot; and &quot;Reverse RX IQ&quot; checkboxes, I suggest the
more informative &quot;I=left, Q=right&quot; and &quot;I=right, Q=left&quot; with radio buttons
or a combo box. This has two advantages. First, it tells people what to do:
they can trace the I and Q routing in their radio (almost; the softrock
schematics don't say which channel is I and which is Q, but this is easy to
fix), then figure out whether the tip or ring is left, and they are done.
With &quot;correct&quot; vs. &quot;reverse&quot; terminology there is no way to figure out what
to do. Second, this is the terminology used in Rocky, and it's easy to
figure out in Rocky whether you are reversed or not (e.g. by checking that
the PSK31 bands which are easy to identify are in the right frequency, or by
checking an SSB signal for correct USB or LSB). I came up with the
suggestion while reading the manual, but this is better fixed in the GUI
than just in the manual.

2. It would be good to add the formula for setting Fiq. I tried to hunt for
the WSPR band yesterday with a crystal-controlled RX-only softrock, even
though I knew the center frequency with reasonable accuracy and even though
I was able to spot the PSK31 signals in Rocky. Between the dial frequency,
BFO frequency, and Fiq, I could not figure out how to set Fiq. It would be
good to have a formula, perhaps with an example.

Regards, Sivan
