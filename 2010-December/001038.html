<PRE>Hi John,

&gt;<i> One consideration is that if fewer than 10 are selected (as in the first
</I>&gt;<i> two columns where 160m was not selected), then in place of the missing
</I>&gt;<i> 160m a random selection will be made from the other 9 bands. This might
</I>&gt;<i> throw the &quot;at least 1 and no more than 3 .. will be a Tx cycle&quot;scheme
</I>&gt;<i> off balance.
</I>
Yes, it will.  But the percentage of Tx slots should remain as requested.

A better statement would be that the number of transmissions in a 2 hour 
period will be &quot;at least one and (on average) no more than half the 
number of times that band was selected.&quot;

... and then...

&gt;<i> However, in the third and fourth columns, 160m was selected as well so
</I>&gt;<i> this should satisfy your 10 band scheme properly. There are several
</I>&gt;<i> places where the max. limit of 3 is exceeded and two where no TX cycle
</I>&gt;<i> was granted. Should more forcing be done in the 6th cycle if TX has not
</I>&gt;<i> be granted for a given band e.g. 17m in the first and last columns?
</I>
As you discovered, I did not have the code quite right.  I'll try to fix 
it later today.

&gt;<i> Presumably the max. limit will depend on pctx? What pctx are you using?
</I>
With pctx &gt;= 50 you should always get 3 Tx periods in 2 hours.  With 
33.3 &lt; pctx &lt; 50 you should get 2 or 3; with 16.7 &lt; pctx &lt; 33.3 you 
should get 1 or 2; with pctx &lt; 16.7 always 1.

If I did what I intended to do, that is ...  :-)
