<PRE>Hi John, Sivan, and all,

Yesterday I added a checkbox labeled &quot;Coordinated bands&quot; at the bottom 
of WSPR's Frequency Hopping screen.  If this box is checked, the &quot;first 
choice&quot; selected band will be determined by the UTC at which a 2-minute 
sequence starts:

  UTC   Band
Minute  (m)
----------------
00      160
02       80
04       60
06       40
08       30
10       20
12       17
14       15
16       12
18       10

20      160
22       80
... etc

The sequence of ten possible bands repeats three times each hour.

If the first choice band has not been checked as an active band, a 
random band choice is made among those that are active.

Decision whether to receive or transmit is purely random, using the 
&quot;pctx&quot; value for the selected band.

If all WSPR stations using frequency hopping use the &quot;Coordinated bands&quot; 
option, a sizable group of will move together from band to band.  During 
any particular sequence, something like 20% of the stations (depending 
on their pctx settings) will transmit, and the rest will receive.  The 
average number of spots will be much larger than that if band selection 
is random.  If a band gets too crowded -- say, if you often see more 
than 6-8 stations in one sequence -- you should probably reduce your 
pctx value for that band.

Does this make sense to you?  Do you see any downside to having many 
stations moving together from band to band?

I'll be running in this mode for the next few days.  Give it a try!

     -- 73, Joe, K1JT
