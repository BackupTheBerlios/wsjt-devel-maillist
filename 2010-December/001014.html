<PRE>Hi Joe and Sivan,

I have been using the new mode since 13:20 UTC on all bands except  
160.  (RX only on 60m)    I think this is a good idea.    There is  
more certainty about when a band will be selected leaving a choice of  
pctx for fine tuning.    Joe's point: &quot; The average number of spots  
will be much larger than that if band selection is random&quot; is  
relevant.   I don't immediately see a problem about having stations  
moving  together from band to band.

This will not work well, however, if pctx is set high since most will  
be transmitting and not receiving.    On the other hand, if all bands  
are &quot;ON&quot; then any one band will be selected only 3 times per hour.    
If pctx is too low then very few transmissions on a given band will  
be made over the course of several hours.   Do we need a mechanism of  
forcing a transmission if one has hasn't been made in n cycles where  
n will have to a function of pctx?   Hmmm.

Switching now to 80 through 30...

I have not see the problem reported by Sivan but will keep checking.
