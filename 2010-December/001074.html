<PRE>I appreciate the efforts that several of you are making on the command-line
wspr0, but I still decided to try a different approach. I need the IQ
processing and I am not eager to try to get a separate program to do the IQ
demodulation (and not too eager to script together everything, although if
Edson comes up with the scripts, I'll be happy to try them).

What I did this morning is to produce a version of WSPR that uses the
existing program but has no GUI. I basically removed or commented out all
the GUI calls from wspr.py, produced stripped down versions of the codes in
WsprMod without the GUI (basically just with the global variables, which
wspr.py uses), and a tiny python code that replaces IntVar, StringVar, and
DoubleVar (which came from Tkinter which I no longer import). I replaced
some of the GUI updates with print statements, so I know what is going on.
Another small modification was to replace update() with a modified function
that runs forever in a loop, sleeping for 200ms at the end of each one. I
can make the sleeping a bit more accurate (to compensate for the time
processing in update takes, but I don't think it matters much).

It took a couple of hours and it now works. I ran it for an hour or so and
produced normal spots.

This version of WSPR uses the existing wspr.ini and hopping.ini in the
directory, so I can set these up with the GUI version (or in a text editor)
and then run the GUI-less version in the same directory, and it has exactly
the same behaviors, just no visual feedback and no way to tweak the behavior
(e.g. to change hopping or to tune).

I'll appreciate any comments on this. I realize that not many people will
want it, and that if the group supports this mode, it will add maintenance
overhead whether we stick to separate files (which will need to be modified
when the main ones are) or integrate the no-hopping option into wspr.py.

When I ran it on my slow computer (266 Geode processor), I discovered two
things. One is that what was taking most of the CPU in WSPR is the GUI. The
GUI version took about 80% CPU even when it was not decoding, just
collection sound. The non-gui version takes only 10%. This might be somewhat
important for people leaving their laptops WSPRing overnight, because they
are less likely to heat up and turn on their fans. This is good.

The other thing I discovered is that the IQ decoding takes a minute and a
half on this machine, and the mept162 takes more than 30 seconds (I am not
sure how long, but more than 30 seconds). So it clearly can't receive and
decode all the 2-minute slots. I think that wspr2 is waiting for the decode
to end before the next cycle begins, but I assume that this is not something
that Joe planned for. Do you guys think that I'll simply get every second or
every third slot processed and the rest will not be received, or will I get
some garbage? I guess the reasonable thing is to get a machine that's a bit
faster.

Regards, Sivan
