<PRE>Hi Joe,

 &gt; The Rx/Tx algorithm in r2285 guarantees that if pctx&gt;0
 &gt; at least 1 and no more than 3 of those six visits [in two
 &gt; hours] will be a Tx cycle.

Some statistics (not many but may be an indication of how this is  
working):

RxTx cycle started at 10:00 UTC    80 through 10 (RX on 80m and  
60m).  pctx=33.    Columns show TX counts in 2 hour sections.   In  
the third 2 hour section 160m RX was added.     The fourth cycle  
ended a few minutes ago at 18:00 UTC.

40:    4    1     4     2
30:    4    2     3     2
20:    2    2     1     3
17:    0    3     1     0
15:    1    2     1     2
12:    4    4     2     1
10:    3    1     4     2
Tot:  18  15  16   12


One consideration is that if fewer than 10 are selected (as in the  
first two columns where 160m was not selected), then in place of the  
missing 160m a random selection will be made from the other 9  
bands.   This might throw the &quot;at least 1 and no more than 3 .. will  
be a Tx cycle&quot;scheme off balance.

However, in the third and fourth columns, 160m was selected as well  
so this should satisfy your 10 band scheme properly.     There are  
several places where the max. limit of 3 is exceeded and two where no  
TX cycle was granted.    Should more forcing be done in the 6th cycle  
if TX has not be granted for a given band e.g. 17m in the first and  
last columns?

Presumably the max. limit will depend on pctx?    What pctx are you  
using?
