<PRE>A correction and some progress.

First, I noticed that the 3.0 manual does state which channel is I and which
is Q in the straight and reversed IQ settings. Sorry about this, but I still
think it would still be good to label them as such in the GUI.

Second, I figured out the Fiq formula (Fiq=dial_freq -
softrock_center_freq). For my 40m softrock receiver, whose central frequency
is 7.056, the settings is theoretically -17400. In practice I found out that
-17285 is much closer to the correct setting.

&gt;<i> Hi Joe,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two small suggestions for the 3.0 manual and GUI:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. Rather than &quot;Reverse TX IQ&quot; and &quot;Reverse RX IQ&quot; checkboxes, I suggest
</I>&gt;<i> the more informative &quot;I=left, Q=right&quot; and &quot;I=right, Q=left&quot; with radio
</I>&gt;<i> buttons or a combo box. This has two advantages. First, it tells people what
</I>&gt;<i> to do: they can trace the I and Q routing in their radio (almost; the
</I>&gt;<i> softrock schematics don't say which channel is I and which is Q, but this is
</I>&gt;<i> easy to fix), then figure out whether the tip or ring is left, and they are
</I>&gt;<i> done. With &quot;correct&quot; vs. &quot;reverse&quot; terminology there is no way to figure out
</I>&gt;<i> what to do. Second, this is the terminology used in Rocky, and it's easy to
</I>&gt;<i> figure out in Rocky whether you are reversed or not (e.g. by checking that
</I>&gt;<i> the PSK31 bands which are easy to identify are in the right frequency, or by
</I>&gt;<i> checking an SSB signal for correct USB or LSB). I came up with the
</I>&gt;<i> suggestion while reading the manual, but this is better fixed in the GUI
</I>&gt;<i> than just in the manual.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2. It would be good to add the formula for setting Fiq. I tried to hunt for
</I>&gt;<i> the WSPR band yesterday with a crystal-controlled RX-only softrock, even
</I>&gt;<i> though I knew the center frequency with reasonable accuracy and even though
</I>&gt;<i> I was able to spot the PSK31 signals in Rocky. Between the dial frequency,
</I>&gt;<i> BFO frequency, and Fiq, I could not figure out how to set Fiq. It would be
</I>&gt;<i> good to have a formula, perhaps with an example.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Regards, Sivan
