<PRE>This seems to work well. I've been receiving all night on 20, 30, 40, and I
spoted both Joe and John many times, most of them during the coordinated
slots. I spotted you guys also on some non-coordinated slots, so I guess you
did not cycle through all 10 bands.

John: 10 spots, 8 coordinated, 2 not coordinated (40m on 5:32 and 20m on
23:16).  This is a bit strange because on both slots John was supposed to be
on other bands. So either it's a bug in the reporting, or John switched to a
different schedule after he wrote the email.

Joe: 8 spots, all on 40m, 6 coordinated plus 22:40 and 23:32.

</I>&gt;<i>  (RX only on 60m)    I think this is a good idea.    There is more certainty

</I>&gt;<i>    Joe's point: &quot; The average number of spots will be much larger than that

</I>&gt;<i> problem about having stations moving  together from band to band.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This will not work well, however, if pctx is set high since most will be
</I>&gt;<i> transmitting and not receiving.    On the other hand, if all bands are &quot;ON&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> then any one band will be selected only 3 times per hour.   If pctx is too
</I>&gt;<i> low then very few transmissions on a given band will be made over the course
</I>&gt;<i> of several hours.   Do we need a mechanism of forcing a transmission if one
</I>&gt;<i> has hasn't been made in n cycles where n will have to a function of pctx?
</I>&gt;<i> Hmmm.

</I>&gt;<i> Switching now to 80 through 30...

</I>&gt;<i> I have not see the problem reported by Sivan but will keep checking.
