<PRE>Hi Sivan,

I made most of the changes you suggested last week, on the same say you 
made them.

The equation for Fiq is in the User's Guide, on page 7.  Also the 
identification of &quot;I=Left, Q=right&quot;, at the bottom of the same page.

I did not make your suggested change to the GUI -- not because I think 
it would be a bad idea to do so, but because I ran out of time and did 
not consider it a very high priority.  Also: I don't claim to know 
whether the correspondence between stereo channel and 3.5 mm connector 
is &quot;Left=Ring, Right=Tip&quot;, or the opposite.

The difference between your &quot;theoretical&quot; -17400 Hz and &quot;correct&quot; -17285 
Hz must be that your actual LO frequency is 7055885, rather than 
7056000, no??

</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Hi Joe,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Two small suggestions for the 3.0 manual and GUI:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 1. Rather than &quot;Reverse TX IQ&quot; and &quot;Reverse RX IQ&quot; checkboxes, I suggest
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the more informative &quot;I=left, Q=right&quot; and &quot;I=right, Q=left&quot; with radio
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> buttons or a combo box. This has two advantages. First, it tells people what
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> to do: they can trace the I and Q routing in their radio (almost; the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> softrock schematics don't say which channel is I and which is Q, but this is
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> easy to fix), then figure out whether the tip or ring is left, and they are
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> done. With &quot;correct&quot; vs. &quot;reverse&quot; terminology there is no way to figure out
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> what to do. Second, this is the terminology used in Rocky, and it's easy to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> figure out in Rocky whether you are reversed or not (e.g. by checking that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the PSK31 bands which are easy to identify are in the right frequency, or by
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> checking an SSB signal for correct USB or LSB). I came up with the
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> suggestion while reading the manual, but this is better fixed in the GUI
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> than just in the manual.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 2. It would be good to add the formula for setting Fiq. I tried to hunt for
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the WSPR band yesterday with a crystal-controlled RX-only softrock, even
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> though I knew the center frequency with reasonable accuracy and even though
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I was able to spot the PSK31 signals in Rocky. Between the dial frequency,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> BFO frequency, and Fiq, I could not figure out how to set Fiq. It would be
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> good to have a formula, perhaps with an example.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Regards, Sivan
