<PRE>Hi Sivan and all,

WSPR has grown in many ways since its original release in early 2008. 
It was originally a command-line program, mainly intended to test the 
ideas behind its coding and modulation scheme.  The original program is 
still available; its instructions are online at

<A HREF="http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/MEPT_Instructions.TXT">http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/MEPT_Instructions.TXT</A>

Now nearly three years later, many new ideas have been added on -- and 
not necessarily in the most efficient possible way.  It's easy to think 
of ways in which WSPR might be structured and written differently, 
starting from scratch.

With that said, I do not see any significant advantage in waking up 
dormant threads for rx, tx, and decode, as opposed to starting new 
threads.  These things are initiated so slowly that the thread startup 
overhead is surely not an important issue.

On the question of running WSPR on your old laptop: is there plenty of 
memory?  WSPR is a bit of a memory hog.

	-- Joe
