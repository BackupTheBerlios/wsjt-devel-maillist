<PRE>Hi Sivan,

Your work in removing the GUI code will also be very valuable. I would be
very much interested in testing it if you could send me a tar file.

The reason I did not worry much about I-Q processing is that I already use
DttSP for demodulating other signals (phone and cw) in the 48 kHz passband
of my online SDRZero receiver (
<A HREF="http://appr.org.br/sdr-br/spectrometer.php?qth=GG56tv">http://appr.org.br/sdr-br/spectrometer.php?qth=GG56tv</A>). For WSPR I need to
further process the demodulated samples and this could be done by resampling
the demodulated wav file to 12 kHz using sox and passing the file to wspr0.
Additional code would be used to upload the spots to WSPRnet (borrowed from
wspr.py).

73,

&gt;<i> I appreciate the efforts that several of you are making on the command-line
</I>&gt;<i> wspr0, but I still decided to try a different approach. I need the IQ
</I>&gt;<i> processing and I am not eager to try to get a separate program to do the IQ
</I>&gt;<i> demodulation (and not too eager to script together everything, although if
</I>&gt;<i> Edson comes up with the scripts, I'll be happy to try them).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> What I did this morning is to produce a version of WSPR that uses the
</I>&gt;<i> existing program but has no GUI. I basically removed or commented out all
</I>&gt;<i> the GUI calls from wspr.py, produced stripped down versions of the codes in
</I>&gt;<i> WsprMod without the GUI (basically just with the global variables, which
</I>&gt;<i> wspr.py uses), and a tiny python code that replaces IntVar, StringVar, and
</I>&gt;<i> DoubleVar (which came from Tkinter which I no longer import). I replaced
</I>&gt;<i> some of the GUI updates with print statements, so I know what is going on.
</I>&gt;<i> Another small modification was to replace update() with a modified function
</I>&gt;<i> that runs forever in a loop, sleeping for 200ms at the end of each one. I
</I>&gt;<i> can make the sleeping a bit more accurate (to compensate for the time
</I>&gt;<i> processing in update takes, but I don't think it matters much).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It took a couple of hours and it now works. I ran it for an hour or so and
</I>&gt;<i> produced normal spots.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This version of WSPR uses the existing wspr.ini and hopping.ini in the
</I>&gt;<i> directory, so I can set these up with the GUI version (or in a text editor)
</I>&gt;<i> and then run the GUI-less version in the same directory, and it has exactly
</I>&gt;<i> the same behaviors, just no visual feedback and no way to tweak the behavior
</I>&gt;<i> (e.g. to change hopping or to tune).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'll appreciate any comments on this. I realize that not many people will
</I>&gt;<i> want it, and that if the group supports this mode, it will add maintenance
</I>&gt;<i> overhead whether we stick to separate files (which will need to be modified
</I>&gt;<i> when the main ones are) or integrate the no-hopping option into wspr.py.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> When I ran it on my slow computer (266 Geode processor), I discovered two
</I>&gt;<i> things. One is that what was taking most of the CPU in WSPR is the GUI. The
</I>&gt;<i> GUI version took about 80% CPU even when it was not decoding, just
</I>&gt;<i> collection sound. The non-gui version takes only 10%. This might be somewhat
</I>&gt;<i> important for people leaving their laptops WSPRing overnight, because they
</I>&gt;<i> are less likely to heat up and turn on their fans. This is good.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The other thing I discovered is that the IQ decoding takes a minute and a
</I>&gt;<i> half on this machine, and the mept162 takes more than 30 seconds (I am not
</I>&gt;<i> sure how long, but more than 30 seconds). So it clearly can't receive and
</I>&gt;<i> decode all the 2-minute slots. I think that wspr2 is waiting for the decode
</I>&gt;<i> to end before the next cycle begins, but I assume that this is not something
</I>&gt;<i> that Joe planned for. Do you guys think that I'll simply get every second or
</I>&gt;<i> every third slot processed and the rest will not be received, or will I get
</I>&gt;<i> some garbage? I guess the reasonable thing is to get a machine that's a bit
</I>&gt;<i> faster.
</I>&gt;<i>
