<PRE>Dear Colleagues,

Thanks to all who responded to my message announcing that source code 
for WSJT and WSPR is once again available at the Berlios repository. 
Today MAP65 has rejoined Berlios, as well.

Of course WSJT, MAP65, and WSPR are distinct programs, but from the 
repository's point of view they are part of the same project, &quot;wsjt&quot;. 
In the repository, MAP65 and WSPR are &quot;branches&quot; off the WSJT &quot;trunk&quot;.

Members of the development team can check out the MAP65 code with the 
command:

$ svn co <A HREF="https://loginname@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/wsjt/branches/map65">https://loginname@svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/wsjt/branches/map65</A>

Anyone can do an anonymous checkout of MAP65 with the command

$ svn co <A HREF="svn://svn.berlios.de/wsjt/branches/map65">svn://svn.berlios.de/wsjt/branches/map65</A>

As of yesterday, the most recent MAP65 code was revision 631.  After 
being moved to Berlios, that same code has revision number 2465 in the 
combined WSJT/MAP65/WSPR repository.

If you have not been paying attention to recent developments, the 
following comments may help to bring you up to date.

MAP65 has been re-written so that the GUI is coded in C++ and Qt, rather 
than Python.  The JT65 encode/decode routines are still mostly in 
Fortran, for speed.  MAP65 supports sub-modes JT65A, B, and C and can be 
used with single-  or dual-polarization antennas and receivers.  The 
baseband sample rate must be either 96000 or 95238 Hz.  The former is 
used for input from soundcards and the FUNcube Dongle, while the latter 
is used with the SRR-IQ, other RFspace receivers, and Perseus.  As with 
earlier versions, MAP65 can be used together with Linrad or SDR-Radio as 
a front end.  The present version can also use input direct from a 
soundcard (for example, with the IQ+ receiver) or from the FUNcube dongle.

The C++/QT framework of MAP65 v2+ offers a number of advantages over the 
older Python-based code.  The program is faster, more attractive, more 
flexible, more modular, more platform independent, and easier to maintain.

Future plans call for the same transition (Python to C++/Qt) to take 
place for WSJT and WSPR.  If you are interested in helping with those 
tasks -- or in other ways such as making installation packages for 
Linux, OS X, FreeBSD, etc. -- please let me know!

     -- 73, Joe, K1JT
