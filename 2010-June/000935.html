<PRE>Hi All,

Many new reports on the WSJT8 modes over the past 24 hours.  Thanks to 
all for the helpful comments, suggestions, and wave files!

JTMS and ISCAT:
---------------

Most reports on ISCAT say it works well.  Decoder is too slow, perhaps. 
  That can (and will) be improved -- probably by a lot.  More examples 
of wave files are needed, examples of both good and poor performance.

Reports on JTMS are more variable.  Some say it works great, seems to 
decode well, produces few junk messages.  Others say that they prefer 
FSK441's ability to decode partial messages, especially very short ones, 
and that they could complete a QSO more quickly with the older mode. 
This is exactly the sort of information that's needed.

EU users: please take note that the message templates can be edited to 
whatever you like; and yes, of course it will be possible to turn off 
the shorthand message feature.

JT64 and JT8:
-------------

Today I established that in WSJT8r1944 the JT8 decoder, like the JT64 
decoder, does not search over enough range in DT to synchronize EME 
signals.  My fault; all of the tests before last weekend had been on 
terrestrial paths.

This was easily fixed.  All JT64 and JT8 EME-path files sent to me now 
decode as they should.

I might package another release tomorrow, so that people can make a few 
more EME tests.  If you do this, please:

1. Send me a few more example wave files.

2. Do not be surprised if JT64 or JT8 still fails to decode, when you're 
pretty sure that JT65B would have been OK.  As I've mentioned before, 
the decoders for these experimental modes are certainly not in final 
form.  They may be slow, they don't compensate for frequency drift, ... 
etc.  It's necessary to walk before we can run.

Again: the main purposes of these very early tests of the experimental 
modes in WSJT8 are two-fold:

1. To generate some real-world wave files, to be used for optimizing the 
decoders.

2. To gather evidence on whether each new experimental mode has the 
potential to be better than the one it might replace.  I have no 
particular stake in a YES or NO answer in each case.  If the answer 
turns out to be no, well and good: future effort can be shifted over to 
further performance enhancements for the existing modes.

If we knew the answers to experiments in advance, there would be no 
point in doing the experiments!

Please keep the reports and wave files coming...

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
