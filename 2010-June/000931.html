<PRE>Many thanks to all who have sent reports on their tests with WSJT8. 
Here's an early summary of what people are discovering.

1. On first startup you must select your audio devices, then exit the 
program and restart.  Yes, it's in the manual ...

2. ISCAT appears to be an excellent mode for 6 meters.  Many QSOs were 
made with it yesterday.  As far as I have heard, its performance is 
excellent -- better than JT6M.  I was pleased yesterday to have my CQs 
on 50.260 answered by many stations... astonishingly, including KF6JEP 
in DM12, 2400 miles away.  Of course this must have been double-hop Es 
-- or perhaps &quot;chord-hop&quot; Es? -- rather than ionoscatter.  Signals were 
barely audible, if at all.  Copy was &quot;all or nothing&quot;, as expected for 
the FEC used in ISCAT.  No other west-coast stations were heard at the 
time (or at any other time yesterday).

3. Some have reported good results with JTMS for meteor scatter on 6m 
and 2m.  Others have not had good results.  If you have WAV files with 
decent JTMS pings, whether they decoded or not, please send me a few.

4. JT64 and JT8 work very well at HF, although the program operating 
features are a bit clunky.  (That can easily be fixed; right now, I'm 
most interested in testing the modes themselves.)

Neither JT64 nor JT8 works for EME -- at least, not in WSJT8r1944. 
Could it be that I have not allowed enough DT range to accopmmodate the 
2.5 s EME delay??  Probably this, or something else stupid, is 
preventing EME decodes.  Or, perhaps, the tone spacing is too close for 
these modes to work without some software AFC ?  It seems that I have 
some work to do.  If you have a few files with good EME signals in JT64 
or JT8, please send them to me for analysis.

I'm traveling for part of next week, but will post messages here when 
there is news to share.

Thanks again for your help in testing the experimental modes in WSJT8.

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
