<PRE>To:   Users of WSJT
From: Joe Taylor, K1JT

A beta release of WSJT8 is now available on the WSJT Home Page.

The following text comes from the first page of the WSJT8 User's Guide,
<A HREF="http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT8_User.pdf">http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT8_User.pdf</A>

######################################################################

WSJT8 is an experimental version of the familiar weak-signal 
communication program WSJT. It offers new protocols or &quot;modes&quot; optimized 
for meteor scatter, ionospheric scatter, EME, microwaves, and QRP at HF. 
Like the modes in previous versions of WSJT, the new ones are intended 
for making minimal QSOs, not for rag-chewing. WSJT8 modes are not 
compatible with those in WSJT7. To use the new modes, transmitting and 
receiving stations must *both* use WSJT8.

This introductory User&#8217;s Guide explains how the new experimental modes 
differ from the familiar modes FSK441, JT6M, JT65, and JT4. It assumes 
that you are already familiar with installing and using WSJT7. Please 
consider the Guide is a living document; it will be modified and 
extended frequently in coming weeks. The online version can be called up 
with a single keystroke from within WSJT8, so you can easily check for 
updates.

My working hypothesis is that the new modes in WSJT8 offer significant 
advantages over those in WSJT7 &#8212; and that it will probably make sense to 
recommend a complete switch-over some months from now. For that 
transition to happen in an orderly fashion, we&#8217;ll need a widely held 
consensus that the change is for the better. If one of the new modes 
does not live up to present expectations, or for another reason it&#8217;s 
decided that some feature of WSJT7 should be retained, that wish can 
probably be accommodated.

Input from users will be important following the initial beta release of 
WSJT8. I need to know what works, what doesn&#8217;t work, what should be 
improved, and what enhancements should be given highest priority. All 
comments and suggestions will be greatly appreciated!

Please note: Before using WSJT8, be sure to read this full document to 
familiarize yourself with the design goals and motivations for the new 
modes, and with the available message formats.
