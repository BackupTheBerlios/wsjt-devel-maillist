<PRE>Hi Dave and all,

The &quot;Log QSO&quot; button in WSJT was never intended to be used 
as a primary station logging tool.  I recommend using a 
separate logging program -- I use DX4WIN, because I have it 
-- for all my primary logging purposes.  I use the &quot;Log QSO&quot; 
button during EME contests, and a few other times, but 
that's about it.  It provides a bare-bones record of your 
WSJT QSOs: date, time, call, grid, band, and mode.  That's all.

With that said, I was unable to reproduce any of the strange 
behavior you describe -- in either WSJT6 or WSJT7.  I can 
enter a callsign by hand, enter a grid, modify a grid read 
from the database file, or whatever ... and after hitting 
&quot;Log QSO&quot; I see the intended information in WSJT.LOG.  In 
short, I don't understand what can have caused the behavior 
you report.

Can anyone else confirm the reported misbehavior?
