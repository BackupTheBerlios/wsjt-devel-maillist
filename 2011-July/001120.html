Subject: [Wsjt-devel] short burst FSK441 for aircraft scatter


&gt;<i> Hi
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Can the FSK441 mode on WSJT be set for 10 secs cycle time ?
</I>
I've swapped a few emails with Richard off reflector about aircraft 
reflection activity in the UK and Europe.

I'm sorry, but I have a personal issue about using the term 'scatter' when 
it's probably reflection that is involved, so appologies if I cross over the 
terms but this is intended to try to help the debate for providing a short 
burst mode in WSJT...

At the UKuG Roundtable event at Finningley ARS this last weekend Ray 
(GM4CXM) gave an excellent talk outlining the requirements for achieving 
reliable contacts based upon various requirements of knowing where aircraft 
are, how big they are, how high they are, where they are going and where the 
other station would need to be to be able to work them by bouncing a signal 
off the aircraft.

To cut the details of the presentation short, Ray showed that reflected 
signals were relatively short, in the order of a few seconds duration, and 
that on 23cm there was a more pronounced head and end ramp up and down than 
on 13cm.  The reflection characteristics on other bands may vary, of 
course...

He also showed that a few aircraft on a similar flight path could improve 
the chances of completing a contact, using fast &quot;HisCall, MyCall, Report&quot; 
(and maybe including a serial number as well for contests) operating 
practice on CW or even SSB could result in completed contacts that were at 
least as valid as Meteor Scatter or Moon Bounce contacts.

Personaly, I've been monitoring, on and off, the signals from GB3CSB, which 
is 355km away from me, on 1296.985MHz which transmits JT4g on every other 
minute.  There are several useful aircraft routes which head to and from 
that direction, so I often see the problem of shifted signals that are not 
decoded, but are visual in the audio waterfall.

In a way, the problem is possibly worse that the EME or Meteor Scatter 
issues, in that you can predict where the moon is and calculate the possible 
effects of Doppler on the received signal and on MS the doppler also tends 
to be in one direction as viewed from a point on the earth.

However, for aircraft reflection it seems that you could have plus or minus 
Doppler (or both together if more than one aircraft is involved) dependant 
on the direction of flight relative to each station observing the path.  I 
have seen traces from a beacon where I see that the reflected signals are 
sinusoidal about the direct signal due to aircraft circling round at various 
heights above ground whilst waiting for a slot to land at one of the UK main 
airports.

On CW, or SSB, what you need to do is give short, sharp transmissions.  Ray 
(GM4CXM) played a recording of one station who called &quot;CQ&quot; for so long that 
the aircraft had long gone before they unkeyed to allow him to call back.  A 
classic case, I hope I've made the case, for an automated system based upon 
PC clocks locked to a good time standard where the transmitted burst of data 
takes no more than 10 seconds (and personally I think that might be too long 
compared to what a reasonable CW operator can do) and is able to cope with 
plus and/or mins dopler effects on the received signals.

A tall order I would guess?
