<PRE>Good evening guys.

I have experience in programming in Assembler,C, C++ and VB,no Fortran 
as yet unfortunately, mostly foe embedded systems.

A while ago a project came to mind, so gather comparative signal 
strength data between 2 antennas, logging the Db signal strength 
difference and originating square onto a database for future extrapolation.

This will give a true description of an antennas effectiveness in 
relation to say a 1/4 wave vertical or dipole in all parts of the world..

WSPR is perfect for this for obvious reasons, it can sit there gathering 
data large enough for statistical analysis.
.

To do this I'm envisaging switching between 2 antennas fairly quickly 
using diodes and adapting/ adding to the S/N decoding code to read the 
two different S/N ratios during the 2 sec RX time and inserted straight 
away into the database along with locator.

The average S/N calculated will no longer be valid for WSPR purposes so 
will have to stop uploads.

I've had a quick look at the source code to gather its structure, 
luckily the Fortran is mostly understandable but can anyone speed me up 
with some pointers or any comments ?

Apologies if this double posted

Regards.
