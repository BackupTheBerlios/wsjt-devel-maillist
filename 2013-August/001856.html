&gt;<i> Joe and Bill,
</I>Hi John,

thanks for the summary of what we have been working with.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The USB Audio Codec on MacOSX supports a 11025Hz frame rate but not 12000 Hz.
</I>That's not technically quite true. AFAIK none of the platforms really 
support fully variable rate clocks on their sound hardware. The 
libraries like the MS Audio, PortAudio, PulseAudio all do automatic 
format and rate conversions in software. I believe that Apple have taken 
a view that arbitrary automatic rate conversions are not compatible with 
their claim of better audio quality than their competitors. They seem to 
have taken the same view even for integral sub-sampling like 12kHz from 
48kHz.

I will speak to my Mac expert today and try and get to the bottom of how 
we can get the OS-X audio system to do sample rate conversions. It may 
turn out that it can only be done by adding some Audio Framework calls 
to enable that sample rate conversion. That will not help us directly 
because the code that would need modifying is part of Qt. It may turn 
out we can submit a patch to Qt.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> r3517 uses portaudio where the frame rate is specified as 12000 Hz but is able to negotiate with  the Mac codec to convert from 11025 to 12000.   QtAudio does not have this flexibility and consequently does not support MacOSX.
</I>As above, its not Qt that is deficient here, its the OS-X Audio Framework.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Two possibilities can be considered.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1).  Mac specific software is incorporated to convert a higher frame rate, e.g 48000 Hz to 12000 Hz.
</I>&gt;<i> The disadvantage of this is that there will be a need to have #ifdefs in various places which goes against the welcome move to remove #ifdefs as far as possible.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 2).  Change the input frame rate to follow MAP65, for instance, where 48000 Hz is used for both input and output.   Then incorporate as standard software a scheme to convert input frame rate to 12000 Hz as required.
</I>&gt;<i> The advantage of this solution is that it retains generality for all platforms.
</I>That would be my choice, it may be wise to make a couple of changes to 
the SoundInput class so it is thread safe and be ready to move it to a 
separate thread. I can do those changes anyway in preparation, there 
won't be any serious cost in performance. It just needs to be all driven 
via Qt slots.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Could Qt experts (and I am not one of these) give some consideration to solving this problem.  For the moment it is now a fact that beyond r3517 Mac OSX is outside the current WSJTX development project.
</I>I'll report back later on the view from someone far more expert in OS-X 
and Darwin issues, so hold fire on any other changes for now John as it 
may be something really easy to switch in simple rate conversions.
