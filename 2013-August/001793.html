<PRE>Bill --

&gt;<i> ... rx decoding seems to have completely stopped
</I>&gt;<i> working for me which is worrying :(
</I>
For what it's worth: that happened to me a few hours ago, too.  And then 
it cleared itself up, and started decoding again.

I thought that during the &quot;bad&quot; time, which lasted maybe half an hour or 
so, signals looked z little bit fizzier on the waterfall than usual. 
Decoding of recorded files was normal.

Could it be that audio input was dropping samples, or something?
I was baffled (and still am), as to what was happening.

It has apparently been OK, since.
