</I>Hi Joe,

</I>&gt;<i> Revision 3542 is running OK in Windows.  Only anomaly I've seen so far

</I>&gt;<i> the top of the next minute.  It's very handy to have that small piece 
</I>&gt;<i> of waterfall available on screen, to see the quiet time before

</I>I am not getting that here on Windows, I have continuous traces on the 
waterfall with time slices missing where I Tx. The probable difference 
is that I have audio during TX while testing since I am not actually 
sending PTT (using VOX with VOX not enabled on the radio. Also I 
normally have the radios Tx monitor on so I always have input.

I've tried with the radio Tx monitor off and I can confirm it happens 
when there is silence on the input for tx period.

I will change the Detector to not bother collecting samples when not 
monitoring and at the same time I will have it resetting jt9com_.kin to 
zero which is the same as prior versions. This may benefit users with 
slower machines, especially uni-processors which are going to be busy 
running two sound threads in parallel.

I assume this is another incarnation of the symspec() difficulties with 
an empty sample buffer.

</I>&gt;<i> location.
