<PRE>Here's a parting thought for the group to ponder while I'm at the beach, 
playing with grandchildren.

As you know, decoding in WSJT-X is now done in the separate program jt9 
(jt9.exe on Windows).  I could have done it in a separate thread, but 
decided to try a separate process this time, with the raw data conveyed 
via a shared memory region.  This works well, but brings with it other 
complications.

Another possibility would be to just call the decoder -- the stuff 
mostly written in Fortran -- directly from the GUI, as a subroutine.  Of 
course we don't want the GUI to freeze while decoding is done... but if 
we put a bunch of calls back to QApplication.processEvents() in the 
Fortran code, so that they would be spaced in time by less than 0.1 s or 
so, it might work well.  As it happens, the necessary hooks for such a 
scheme are already mostly in place in the form of calls to timer(), a 
simple routine I wrote to do profiling of the Fortran code.  Nearly all 
of the calls to timer -- typically several thousand of them while 
decoding a single Rx sequence -- are spaced by less than 0.1 s on a 
modern computer.  So we could place calls to 
QApplication.processEvents() inside timer(), and the job might be done.

Would this possibly be a good idea?  Your thoughts?
