</I>Well whatever it is I have a much worse case than that. I have what 
looks like a good waterfall going by but not a single decode since I 
checked in the changes.

I was using the new version last night with no real problems and I 
thought the changes I made today were on on the Tx and GUI .

Clearly I've done something really dumb somewhere. jt9 seems to run in a 
very short time as well.

I've just tried setting save to &quot;All&quot; and played back a period in r3520; 
it decodes! So is it the decoding that is broken or is the passing back 
of decodes to the GUI?

I'm also baffled.
