Hi Bill,
Hi Greg

</I>&gt;<i>On the first decode after start-up I'm getting an error stating wsjtx cannot find kvad, then everything seems fine.&gt; There is an auxiliary program that wsjt-x used for decoding called kvasd, we don't build it. The CMake scripts should download the &gt; correct version from the net as part of the 'make install' target. Is the message saying that 'kvasd' is missing or is it 'kvasd.dat'?
</I>
The error says sh: 1 ./kvad not found, here is a screen capture:

The second thing, which is more of a problem for me is, Tx power levels seem really low. I have to have the slider all the way up and the Navigator at about 12 O'Clock to get near 25W on JT65 .. normally, or on my Windows box. those setting would generate stupid amounts of TX PWR. Im not sure if this is a Linux or Wsjtx thing. Maybe others have seen it as well, not sure.
&gt;&gt;<i> I think you are saying that the o/p is lower on a Unix machine. It might be that the main audio system levels are reduced. If you run the mixer program ('pavucontrol' with PulseAudio on Linux) you can check the master levels. Definitely don't worry about setting the o/p level all the way up on the wsjt-x interface, it is an attenuator in the digital domain so is dividing the sample values which reduces &#160;resolution. 0dB attenuation is the best place to start and only reduce it if you don't have analogue audio settings further down the line.
</I>
I tried&#160;pavucontrol, didn't have a large affect on TX, but certainly did on RX. TX slider is still all the way up an Navigator RF out control is between 11 O'Clock and 1 O'Clock to produce a test tone of 25-30W. I have not made any QSO's with things in this state as I'm unsure of the TX quality so I'm just testing the controls with quick bursts.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>Pskreporter speed. I've not timed this, but reports to Hamspots &amp; Pskreport seem to be &quot;much&quot; slower that the Windows versions. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I'm not sure, but I think one or both of those may have been slowed down recently to cope with higher volumes of traffic.
</I>
Roger that, but we're talking on the order of 5 to 8 minutes delay. On my current Windows build, it's 1 to 2 minutes max.
