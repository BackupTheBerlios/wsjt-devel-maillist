</I>This is due to the way we use a separate process to run the hamlib 
utility rigctl to get the list of supported radios. The config dialog 
blocks waiting for it to finish for up to 1s.

There are a few of options:

1) reduce the wait delay - not good since we shouldn't be blocking the 
GUI thread anyway,

2) don't wait and let the combo box of radios fill asynchronously (it is 
already using a signal so this is trivial). Currently we put the 9998 &amp; 
9999 entries in after the wait, but we could hook the QProcess 
finished() signal to do that.

3) use the hamlib API to lookup the supported radios assuming it can do 
it fast enough - if it can't then a QFuture might be ideal as it could 
return the full list on completion.

4) Build the setup dialog at program startup and use show()/hide() to 
present it. This has the downside that it wouldn't  pickup new audio 
devices, but that could be fixed pretty easily.

I think (2) is probably best value for the work although (3) is worth 
investigating at some point. The consequence of (2) is that the user 
might see the combobox of radios filling but that isn't serious IMHO.
