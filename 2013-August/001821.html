Yes! Good work, Greg. Even though wsjtx builds correctly, ldd does not
show any missing libraries, and there are no runtime error messages,
without that additional package no audio devices are listed. The small
&quot;test&quot; program does demonstrate the same behavior.

I believe this is specific to Ubuntu 12.04 and 12.10. In 13.04, the Qt
packages appear to have different names, and I am unsure which
supplies that functionality, but it just happened to be already
installed on my 13.04 system.

Now that it is working, I see the names of the audio devices are not
as recognizable as they used to be, e.g.
&quot;alsa_output.pci-0000_06_00.0.analog-stereo&quot;.

I also noted that Decode was taking way too long, looked at process
activity with &quot;top&quot;, and saw that Xorg was hogging the CPU. It was
because I had left pavucontrol running and its realtime updating of
its VU meters is extremely X-intensive!


&gt;<i> From: Joe Taylor &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/wsjt-devel">joe at princeton.edu</A>&gt; ...
</I>&gt;<i> I went to <A HREF="http://qt-project.org/downloads">http://qt-project.org/downloads</A> and downloaded from the link
</I>&gt;<i> labeled &quot;Qt 5.1.0 for Linux 32-bit (417 MB)&quot;.
</I>
That site looks like a good resource, but it does not specify what
version of linux it is built for, i.e. if libc and other libraries
installed on your system are compatible.


&gt;<i> I was unsure of the &quot;proper&quot; place to install in linux (it's Ubuntu 12.04), so I installed in my home directory.
</I>
That is another advantage of the &quot;apt-get install&quot; methodology.


&gt;<i>  Available audio devices appear in the list and seem to work as expected.
</I>
OK, I will not argue with success!
