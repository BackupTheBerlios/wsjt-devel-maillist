</I>&gt;<i> Of course we don't want the GUI to freeze while decoding is done... 
</I>&gt;<i> but if we put a bunch of calls back to QApplication.processEvents() in

</I>&gt;<i> 0.1 s or so, it might work well.  As it happens, the necessary hooks 
</I>&gt;<i> for such a scheme are already mostly in place in the form of calls to 
</I>&gt;<i> timer(), a simple routine I wrote to do profiling of the Fortran 
</I>&gt;<i> code.  Nearly all of the calls to timer -- typically several thousand 
</I>&gt;<i> of them while decoding a single Rx sequence -- are spaced by less than 
</I>&gt;<i> 0.1 s on a modern computer.  So we could place calls to 
</I>&gt;<i> QApplication.processEvents() inside timer(), and the job might be done.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Would this possibly be a good idea?  Your thoughts?
</I>I would wrap the call to the jt9 decoder in a QObject, implement the 
start trigger as a slot (that way it can cross thread boundaries 
safely), pass a &quot;C&quot; style callback function to the Fortran code along 
with a void * pointer that would be the &quot;this&quot; ponter of the wrapper, 
then whenever jt9 needs to send infomation back it would call the 
callback which would then recover the this pointer and emit a Qt signal 
with any callback parameters (probably a struct or small value type 
class that contained an individual decode) that would be connected to 
the GUI thread to display the decodes.

This is dependant on the internal architecture of the Fortran code and 
how easy it would be to pass around the callback and its data (the 
pointer) to be used to return messages.

The key being that because all communication is via slots and signals it 
can easily be run in a separate thread.
