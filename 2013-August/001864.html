&gt;<i>

</I>Ok, I am moving on with that, once John G4KLA and I get the OS-X version 
up and running with QAudioInput.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the CMake front I made negative progress today, and I'm not sure 
</I>&gt;<i> why.  I can't seem to build in MinGW using the CMake scripts now, even 
</I>&gt;<i> though I succeeded (once) yesterday.  Today I'm back to having it fail 
</I>&gt;<i> to find the &quot;glu32&quot; library.  I have no idea why it succeeded (once) 
</I>&gt;<i> yesterday, but now fails.
</I>That's not good. I suspect you and I may be the only ones using it on 
Windows so hopefully I will have it sorted out before you get back from 
your travels Joe. Because Windows is a cross compile and because there 
are no &quot;standard places&quot; to find pre-requisites; it will take a little 
more time to iron out the kinks. As discussed, I won't be checking 
anything that breaks the old qmake and make process. As a secondary 
stream I am trying to do the Windows MinGW build on Linux, this will 
have a bonus of being able to produce a 64-bit version without having to 
resort to the MS toolchain which will run a bit faster due to the larger 
number of registers available to the compiler for optimization.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, I've put CMake aside for now.  I built libjt9.a and jt9.exe 
</I>&gt;<i> using .../lib/Makefile.MinGW, and wsjtx.exe (v1.2 r3556) from within 
</I>&gt;<i> QtCreator, as I have always done before.  I checked out the resulting 
</I>&gt;<i> package and believe it is complete -- I hope our users will find no 
</I>&gt;<i> installation problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I really appreciate all the recent contributions here!  This project 
</I>&gt;<i> has become very much a group effort, and the results provide strong 
</I>&gt;<i> evidence of the skills and experience you bring to it.
</I>&gt;<i>
