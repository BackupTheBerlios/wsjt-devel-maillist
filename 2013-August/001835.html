</I>&gt;<i> I built in on my laptop and server, both compiled without error. I

</I>Thanks for trying out the new scripts, glad it worked ok for you.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I saw David VK4BDJ working, also picked up ZS2 and TR8 on 30m so the

</I>&gt;<i> However, I am seeing a couple of odd events, but it's on 3547 before 
</I>&gt;<i> and and after Cmake implementation. Luckily, I had the old version 
</I>&gt;<i> compiled still.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On the first decode after start-up I'm getting an error stating wsjtx 
</I>&gt;<i> cannot find kvad, then everything seems fine.
</I>There is an auxiliary program that wsjt-x used for decoding called 
kvasd, we don't build it. The CMake scripts should download the correct 
version from the net as part of the 'make install' target. Is the 
message saying that 'kvasd' is missing or is it 'kvasd.dat'?
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> The second thing, which is more of a problem for me is, Tx power 
</I>&gt;<i> levels seem really low. I have to have the slider all the way up and 
</I>&gt;<i> the Navigator at about 12 O'Clock to get near 25W on JT65 .. normally, 
</I>&gt;<i> or on my Windows box. those setting would generate stupid amounts of 
</I>&gt;<i> TX PWR. Im not sure if this is a Linux or Wsjtx thing. Maybe others 
</I>&gt;<i> have seen it as well, not sure.
</I>I think you are saying that the o/p is lower on a Unix machine. It might 
be that the main audio system levels are reduced. If you run the mixer 
program ('pavucontrol' with PulseAudio on Linux) you can check the 
master levels. Definitely don't worry about setting the o/p level all 
the way up on the wsjt-x interface, it is an attenuator in the digital 
domain so is dividing the sample values which reduces resolution. 0dB 
attenuation is the best place to start and only reduce it if you don't 
have analogue audio settings further down the line.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Pskreporter speed. I've not timed this, but reports to Hamspots &amp; 
</I>&gt;<i> Pskreport seem to be &quot;much&quot; slower that the Windows versions.
</I>I'm not sure, but I think one or both of those may have been slowed down 
recently to cope with higher volumes of traffic.
