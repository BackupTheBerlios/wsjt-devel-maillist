</I>&gt;<i> I'm using your shaped keying now.  What is it that you're not 100%

</I>I agree it works well even though it is just a crude trapezoid envelope, 
but I found that on my super-duper laptop sound card the o/p sounded 
distinctly rough when the shaping was applied. I have turned off all the 
effects but still it isn't right. The sound card is basically a 24-bit 
196kHz model and I wondered if the wider bandwidth was showing up the 
corners in the waveform.

On the sound card I drive my radio with it all sounds great.

I am trying a power curve instead to see how that works out and will 
report back.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> On another matter you have raised: I have never used cmake, but would 
</I>&gt;<i> love to have a configuration that allowed anyone to check out our 
</I>&gt;<i> source code and then do something like
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> $ cd wsjtx
</I>&gt;<i> $ cmake
</I>&gt;<i> $ make
</I>&gt;<i> $ make install
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> on any supported platform.  Is this pie in the sky, or is it possible?
</I>That is my aim. For cross compiles there will need to be a local tool 
chain configuration file and those with multiple compilers and associate 
libraries that will also need some hints to find the wanted variant.

I also hope to have the cmake script build deployment targets as well so 
that final packages can be produced if required. So you can add 'make 
package' to that list of commands.

Might be nice to see a 'make test' target too ;)

That way all the mundane boilerplate to develop, maintain and deliver 
the software can be captured in a script.
