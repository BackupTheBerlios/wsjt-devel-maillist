<PRE>Hi All,

As part of improving the keying in wsjtx it has become apparent that the 
current synthesiser can be simplified if sending MFSK data, CW data and, 
tuning were 3 distinct functions rather than the current implementation 
where they are intermingled.

Does anyone have any objections if I were to divided them into three 
separate algorithms sharing common base tools like sinusoid generation 
and noise generation and keying. I would implement as three separate 
messages (slots) to start one of the above with common a common signal 
to notify of completion. There would be a common mute message that 
toggles generation on and off without loss of synchronisation and, an 
interrupt message (which would be also the means of terminating the tune 
state). The main benefits would be simpler &amp; clearer code and the 
possibility of the generator being responsible for implicit timing of 
messages rather than having to run parallel timers.

The only consequence I can see is that at present it is technically 
possible to switch to a single tone tuning signal while sending an MFSK 
data stream or CW message and then revert back to the message while 
maintaining continuous phase. Given that a message is continuous phase 
and amplitude I can't see any reason to switch back and forth between 
tuning and message.
