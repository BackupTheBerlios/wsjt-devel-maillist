</I>Yes, it's just as simple as telling the modulator go to idle and signal 
that change. This is easy now it runs in the GUI thread.

</I>I agree in principle, but I see a lot of code in the MainWindow that 
wouldn't be necessary (or would be hidden away in the implementation of 
some cooperating classes) if we had some signals coming back from the 
transmit process to drive the GUI state.

I do have an ulterior motive. I'd like to see the GUI state handling 
move to a more event driven model. I find it very hard to understand the 
flow where there is a mix of a lot of sequential code intermingled with 
event handling code. Qt has a nice state machine implementation which 
integrates very well with signals and properties and seems absolutely 
suited to the JT modes which are strict state machines themselves. By 
implementing or re-factoring functionality slowly towards object classes 
that are driven by slot and signal events with properties to parametrize 
their behaviour; we wouldn't be pushing uphill so much against Qt.

I am testing some minor changes the new Modulator to test this 
sequencing approach without actually changing the tx logic in the 
mainwindow code.
