<PRE>Hi Bill,

Very Nice !!

I built in on my laptop and server, both compiled without error. I have the Laptop monitoring 20m out in the shack.

I saw David VK4BDJ working, also picked up ZS2 and TR8 on 30m so the rcv side of things seems normal.

However, I am seeing a couple of odd events, but it's on 3547 before and and after Cmake implementation. Luckily, I had the old version compiled still.

On the first decode after start-up I'm getting an error stating wsjtx cannot find kvad, then everything seems fine.

The second thing, which is more of a problem for me is, Tx power levels seem really low. I have to have the slider all the way up and the Navigator at about 12 O'Clock to get near 25W on JT65 .. normally, or on my Windows box. those setting would generate stupid amounts of TX PWR. Im not sure if this is a Linux or Wsjtx thing. Maybe others have seen it as well, not sure.

Pskreporter speed. I've not timed this, but reports to Hamspots &amp; Pskreport seem to be &quot;much&quot; slower that the Windows versions.&#160;

Subject: [Wsjt-devel] WSJT-X: CMake scripts
 

Hi All,

A long post but hopefully worth it.

I have just committed r3548 which is the first phase of a demonstration 
of using CMake to configure and build WSJT-X. This is work in progress 
so don't expect it to make the tea for you just yet.

I am able to use it to generate working makefiles to build on Linux and 
on Windows at the moment. It may work as is on OS-X but I haven't tested 
it there.

To use it you need ensure you have the following pre-requisites 
installed on your development system (you probably have most of them 
there already if you are developing for wsjtx):

Qt
==
Qt at least version 5.1. I use the standard packaged version on Linux. 
On Ubuntu 13.04 I used

sudo apt-get install qt5-default qttools5-dev-tools qtmultimedia5-dev 
qtcreator

If you distribution doesn't have these packages or equivalents then just 
get a suitable package from this page <A HREF="http://qt-project.org/downloads">http://qt-project.org/downloads</A> .

On Windows I used the install from 
<A HREF="http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/online_installers/qt-windows-opensource-1.4.0-x86-online.exe">http://download.qt-project.org/official_releases/online_installers/qt-windows-opensource-1.4.0-x86-online.exe</A> 
and installed into C:\Tools\Qt In the component selection the defaults 
are fine although I deselected the MinGW-4.7 part because the MinGW-4.8 
compiler tools are better for C++.

DirectX9
========
On MS Windows Qt has a dependency on the MS DirectX9 library, this is 
for the ANGLE library which is shim library that maps basic OpenGL calls 
to DirectX functions without using the OpenGL libraries. Unfortunately 
even if you don't use OpenGL in your Qt application; the library is 
referenced. The easiest way to get it is to install a recent Windows SDK 
which these days have DirectX bundled. I install the Windows 8.0 SDK 
from 
<A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh852363.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh852363.aspx</A> . 
You may have an older SDK or the older unbundled DirectX SDK installed, 
that's fine CMake should find it.

CMake
======
CMake at least version 2.8.9. I use the standard packaged version on linux.

On Windows I installed the CMake binary package using the installer 
<A HREF="http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.11.2-win32-x86.exe">http://www.cmake.org/files/v2.8/cmake-2.8.11.2-win32-x86.exe</A> and 
installed it into C:\Tools (I don't let installers install into the 
Program Files folders unless it is really necessary and in this case it 
isn't). I make sure that the 'bin' directory in the package is on my 
PATH environment variable. (A word of warning on the environment setup 
for the MinGW shell that Qt project sets up; when changing the PATH 
variable always ensure that the Qt paths are first otherwise the build 
environment will not work).

FFTW
=====
WSJT-X has a dependency on the FFTW version 3 package, it requires the 
single precision variant. Current we statically link this library. I 
have used dynamic linking in the CMake script since this library is 
likely to be shared by several applications (this can be changed to 
static linking if required).

On Linux I ensured that the correct package was installed with:

sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev libfftw3-single3

On Windows I installed the binary package from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.fftw.org/pub/fftw/fftw-3.3.3-dll32.zip">ftp://ftp.fftw.org/pub/fftw/fftw-3.3.3-dll32.zip</A> into 
C:\Tools\fftw-3.3.3-dll32 (beware; this archive doesn't have a top level 
directory so you have to create a folder to extract into).

HAMLIB
=======
WSJT-X has a dependency on the HAMLIB version2 package.

On Linux I ensured that the correct package was installed with:

sudo apt-get libhamlib-dev

On Windows I installed the binary package from 
<A HREF="https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/hamlib/hamlib/1.2.15.3/hamlib-win32-1.2.15.3.zip">https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/hamlib/hamlib/1.2.15.3/hamlib-win32-1.2.15.3.zip</A> 
into C:\Tools .

Advice on using CMake
====================
CMake is a configuration and makefile generator. The idea is that you 
run it once for each configuration you want to build and after that you 
use the generated makefiles to build the project.

For simple native builds the only extra input you need to give CMake 
should be about what you want to build and where you want the results to 
go. On non-native builds (cross compiles for example, and MinGW on 
Windows is technically a cross compile) you need to provide some 
information about what target you are building for and where required 
packages can be found. This is all done via the CMake command line 
although with cross compiles it is better to capture the information in 
a toolchain file that can be reused for other projects.

I strongly recommend building outside of the source tree. CMake fully 
supports this and it is much easier to develop if the source tree isn't 
full of build intermediate files and products. The following 
instructions follow this guideline.

I also strongly recommend that you create a test install directory and 
use that to test and debug the project rather than having to find the 
executables in the build tree. I use ~/test-install .

Native builds
===========
To run CMake on non-Windows systems for a native build I suggest you 
create two directories for Debug and Release builds respectively, I use 
~/objdir/wsjtx/{Debug,Release} so example to set up I would type:

mkdir -p ~/objdir/wsjtx/{Debug,Release}

Then cd to the Debug directory and run:

cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/test-install 
~/src/wsjtx

Then cd to the Release directory and repeat (note the different BUILD_TYPE):

cd ../Release
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/test-install 
~/src/wsjtx

That should, if all goes well, be the last time you use CMake directly.

To do a build cd into one of the build directories and run 'make install':

cd ../Debug
make install

The project should build and in ~/test-install/bin you should have a 
program you can test:

cd ~/test-install
./wsjtx

If you want a release build just run the 'make install' in the Release 
directory.

Non-native Builds
===============
Building on Windows with MinGW is technically a cross compile so we need 
to provide some extra information to CMake. The best way to do this is 
to create a toolchain file somewhere away from the source tree that 
describes the target and where to find the pre-requisite components on 
your system. Your toolchain file will probably be different from mine, 
but once you get it right you shouldn't need to change it. I have the 
following file:
(NOTE: the MinGW 4.8 32 bit toolset bundled with Qt5.1 has all the 
required build tools so I run builds from the shell that it provides - 
the one named &quot;Qt 5.1.0 for Desktop (MinGW 4.8 32 bit)&quot;)

C:\Tools\Qt\5.1.0\mingw48_32&gt;cmake --version
cmake version 2.8.11.2

C:\Tools\Qt\5.1.0\mingw48_32&gt;type 
\Users\bill\Documents\objdir\Toolchain-mingw48_32-Qt5.cmake
# the name of the target operating system
set (CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Windows)

set (QTDIR C:/Tools/Qt/5.1.0)
set (FFTWDIR C:/Tools/fftw-3.3.3-dll32-2)
set (HAMLIBDIR&#160; C:/Tools/hamlib-win32-1.2.15.3)

# where to find required packages
set (CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH ${QTDIR}/mingw48_32 ${FFTWDIR} ${HAMLIBDIR} 
${HAMLIBDIR}/bin)

# where the target environment located
set (CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH&#160; ${QTDIR}/mingw48_32 
$ENV{HOMEDRIVE}$ENV{HOMEPATH}/Documents/test-install)

# adjust the default behaviour of the FIND_XXX() commands:
# search headers and libraries in the target environment, search
# programs in the host environment
set (CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
set (CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY BOTH)
set (CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE BOTH)

C:\Tools\Qt\5.1.0\mingw48_32&gt;

NOTE: CMake doesn't like backslashes, if you insist on using them then 
escape them with a backslash.

CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME tells CMake the target system is Windows.
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH is a list of places to start looking for packages, 
libraries, paths and, files.
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH is a list of places to find runtime dependencies.
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM is set to never use tools that aren't 
designed for the target.
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY is set to allow libraries from for 
both the target and the host.
CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE is set to allow header files for both 
the target and the host.

Once the toolchain file is set up you can run CMake. As per the native 
build instructions above I recommend building outside of the source tree 
and use the 'install' option to generate a working result in a separate 
test area. My SVN source tree is 
C:\Users\bill\Documents\vbox-shares\transfer\wsjtx and I build in 
C:\Users\bill\Documents\objdir\wsjtx\mingw48_32 with installs going to 
C:\Users\bill\Documents\test-install .

So to run CMake I do the following:

cd \Users\bill\Documents\objdir\wsjtx\mingw48_32
mkdir Debug Release
cd Debug
cmake -G &quot;MinGW Makefiles&quot; 
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=..\..\..\Toolchain-mingw48_32-Qt5.cmake 
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug 
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=\Users\bill\Documents\test-install 
\Users\bill\Documents\vbox-shares\transfer\wsjtx

To set up the release makefiles execute a similar command in the Release 
directory:

cd ..\Release
cmake -G &quot;MinGW Makefiles&quot; 
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=..\..\..\Toolchain-mingw48_32-Qt5.cmake 
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug 
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=\Users\bill\Documents\test-install 
\Users\bill\Documents\vbox-shares\transfer\wsjtx

If all goes well you are ready to build the project. To build the Debug 
target:

cd ..\Debug
mingw32-make install

and you should get a result in the install prefix bin directory (in my 
case \Users\bill\Documents\test-install\bin\ which you should be able to 
test or debug.
