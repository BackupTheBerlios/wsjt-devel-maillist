<PRE>Hi All,

some more changes. Highlights include audio channel selection and tx 
audio level control.


===================================================================================
------------------------------------------------------------------------
r3542 | bsomervi | 2013-08-10 16:29:55 +0100 (Sat, 10 Aug 2013) | 100 lines

Added audio channel support.

Audio input can be mono, left of stereo pair or, right of stereo
pair. Audio output can be mono, left of stereo pair, right of stereo
pair or, both of stereo pair (the same output goes to both channels in
both mode). Settings are remembered between sessions.

Stream channel suport is implemented mainly in the new AudioDevice
class which is now the base class of Modulator and Detector.

Audio channels are selected on the configuration screen. Only
supported channel configurations per device can be selected.

Audio output volume (actually attenuation) is now possible from the
GUI. I have added a slider control to the main window; I don't
necessarily propose this as a final release location for the widget as
I understand that changes to the main screen are sensitive. This
location is just a starting suggestion for a trial. The volume
(attenuation) setting is remembered between sessions and is not device
dependent. This addresses all issues of volume setting on *nix
versions since there is no need to use pavucontrol to set audio
levels. The volume (attenuation) action is logarithmic.

Shaped CW keying has been implemented in Modulator although it is
currently disabled as I am not 100% happy wth the implementation. If
you want to try it define the C++ preprocessor macro WSJT_SOFT_KEYING
in your build.

The Modulator instance has been moved to the same thread as the
SoundOutput instance as it should have been since the output callback
already operates in that thread. Cross thread slots are now correctly
called in a thread safe way as a result.

A number of files where in the SVN repository with DOS line endings
which I have removed. SVN users on Windows need set the config for
native line endings so that DOS line endings are automatically
stripped on checkin.

The DevSetup class now holds it's UI o the heap to reduce imapact on
build dependencies.

The application settings are now passed to objects from the main.cpp
file. Management of settings are moved to the responsible classes (top
level windows). This has involved a few settings moving groups so
users will see some settings reverting to default values on the first
run of an update.

Persistance of top level windows geometry and position is now handled
in the recommened manner (constructor for load, closeEvent for store
in modal windows and, hideEvent for store in modeless dialogs).

The MainWindow class now holds its children as members rather than
global variables.

The LogQSO class now hides its implementation and takes responsibility
for its own settings and widows rendering parameters. A new settings
file group is implemented to persist the LogQSO class settings.

The WideGraph class now hides its implementation and manages its own
settings and window rendering parameters.
