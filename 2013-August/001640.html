</I>The QtMultimedia library is another library so it's not really any less, 
but at least a lots of *nixes have the Qt libraries because of it's use 
in KDE etc. It might be an issue that it's only in Qt5 because Linux 
users with older distros might only have Qt4 in their repos.

I'm not sure if it's possible to do a static build with Qt. It should be 
so long as the C++ library is left as a shared lib.

I'm actually developing on a Linux VM since Unix is my normal hang out. 
I build and test on Windows because that's where I have radio 
connectivity. I will see if I can get my dev VM configured for audio as 
well as it's a bit of a PITA to keep copying sources around to build and 
test.

&lt;snip&gt;

I have already completed the first round of changes with portaudio. The 
question that started this part of the thread was aimed at avoiding 
going down the dual implementation approach. I would like to move on by 
swapping out portaudio for QAudioInput/QAudioOutput. We can always 
revert back if there are any show stoppers.

</I>&gt;<i> The pitfalls I had with QAudio in the past were primarily related to 
</I>&gt;<i> threads. Since we will try running the audio from the GUI thread, 
</I>&gt;<i> there should be no thread-related issues. It remains to be seen if it 
</I>&gt;<i> will be possible to run the audio outuput without it running on a 
</I>&gt;<i> separate thread. We need to run some tests with WSJT-X on slower 
</I>&gt;<i> computers to make sure things are ok since a lot of graphics consume 
</I>&gt;<i> CPU cycles in the GUI thread and audio output can't starve from CPU.
</I>I believe the separate thread was adding latency rather than removing 
it. The main blocking audio processing was away from wsjtx already, we 
are only doing what we have to do to read/generate samples and I don't 
think that part is very intensive. The main decode pass on the other 
hand is, but that is already outside of the GUI loop by being done in a 
separate process.

I agree on running on more CPU cycle challenged systems, we need a 
benchmark system somewhere that acts as a control test for performance 
related changes. All my older machines are dead or dying so my slowest 
machine is a quad core i7. There are stress testing tools around that 
put a fixed load on a machine while using it for performance testing.
