<PRE>Hi All,

Requires Qt5  (at least only tested on against Qt5 so far):

Hopefully I haven't broken too many things with my first checkin.

=============================================================
Qt 5 Audio replaces PortAudio.

Currently only Qt5 or above is known to work with this code. It may be
possible to backport it to Qt4 if required.

Audio output goes back to a separate thread to try and minimize
stutters in streaming on Windows particularly.

A crash on Linux due to mishandling of stereo audio output has been
fixed and both left and right channels are now correctly synthesised
with identical contents.

Rigs are enumerated directly from hamlib API rather than running a sub
process reading output of rigctl -l. This was initially done to get
rid of some GUI thread blocking in the configuration dialog, but is
generally a better way of doing it anyway.

Some refactoring in MainWindow to accomodate the audio streaming,
modulation and detecting classes.

Exit handling for application refactored to use signals rather than
brute force event loop exit. This was required to get correct thread
shutdown semantics.

The GUI update timer is now stopped during application shutdown which
is necessary to stop crashes when shutting down gracefully with
signals and window close() calls.

There is an outstanding issue with Linux audio streams; the QAudio
Input/Output classes create a new stream name each time a stream is
started. This doesn't play well with PulseAudio utilities such as
pavucontrol to set stream volume as settings are lost every tx
period. I have tried to keep a single stream for all output but there
are problems restarting it that haven't been resolved yet.

The QtCreator project file has been rearranged a little because it
passes all the object files to the linker rather than using an archive
library. Since the GNU linker is single pass; the object files need to
be in a logical order with definitions appearing afer references to
them. This was required to avoid a linking error.

The lib/Makefile.linux has been enhanced to use the fortran compiler
to locate the correct version of the Fortran library to use. This is
necessary on the latest Linux distros because the unversioned symlink
to compiler support libraries is no longer provided. This only an
issue with mixed programming language links where the linker driver
for one language has to link support libraraies for another language.
===============================================================
