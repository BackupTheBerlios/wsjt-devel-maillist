<PRE>Bill --

I'll respond to several points you raised.

&gt;&gt;<i> My quick-and-dirty Qt-Audio-based soundin code seems to work fine in
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Windows, but so far is not fully successful in Linux. Probably I've
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> made coding errors; I haven't yet traced down the different behavior.
</I>&gt;<i> Ok, I had a quick look at it and it look ok to me. What isn't working?
</I>
David and Claude report segfaults when they try to run it in Linux.  On 
my Linux box it's slightly different: without recompiling, sometimes it 
starts and runs OK; other times it crashes shortly after starting.  Must 
be an unitialized variable, or a buffer overflow, or some other mistake; 
but I haven't found the cause.  Same code does not crash in Windows.

&gt;<i> 1) I have been trying to get rid of some of the global variables so that
</I>&gt;<i> the code can be reentrant. I know the main sample buffers are shared
</I>&gt;<i> data for good reason but I believe even they can be address with some
</I>&gt;<i> thought. The driving force is that global variables make debugging and
</I>&gt;<i> extending far more difficult. C++ is about abstractions and
</I>&gt;<i> implementation hiding and the benefits of that can't be achieved in the
</I>&gt;<i> presence of global data.
</I>
Yes, I understand the arguments.  Old habits die hard.

Many weeks ago, Edson and I agreed that it was worth trying the program 
without any shared memory region at all -- just have jt9 read the raw 
data from disk.  (It's already being written to disk, anyway.  They are 
simply deleted, some 40 seconds later, if &quot;Save&quot; is set to &quot;None&quot;.)  I 
suspect the performance hit would be negligible.

&gt;<i> The QtMultimedia library is another library so it's not really any
</I>&gt;<i> less, but at least a lots of *nixes have the Qt libraries because
</I>&gt;<i> of it's use in KDE etc. It might be an issue that it's only in Qt5
</I>&gt;<i> because Linux users with older distros might only have Qt4 in their
</I>&gt;<i> repos.
</I>
It *is* less in one way: to build the program you need only to install 
Qt.  The QAudio classes are in Qt4, as well as Qt5 -- although some Qt4 
packages may have omitted QAudio.

Static builds with Qt are possible but I believe they require building 
Qt itself (also QtCreator?) from source.

&gt;<i> I would like to move on by swapping out portaudio for
</I>&gt;<i> QAudioInput/QAudioOutput. We can always revert back if there are
</I>&gt;<i> any show stoppers.
</I>
I'd say go ahead with this plan.

&gt;<i> There are stress testing tools around that put a fixed load on a
</I>&gt;<i> machine while using it for performance testing.
</I>
I had not heard of these before.  Might be useful?
