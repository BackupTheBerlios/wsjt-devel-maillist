There are WSJT issues on Mandriva 2008.1 as well. I'm almost there on 
WSPR, managed to get the GUI up but still segfault on the first decode 
cycle.

Some of the older Fortran libs are no longer available on the most 
recent distros. They'd still be there on the older distros that have 
been upgraded, but not on a fresh install. These libs have been 
depreciated, so work-arounds will need to be made to account for this. I 
suspect this will take a bit, but the effort will be worth it. On 
Mandriva g95 is optional and not installed by default, but it's in contribs.

Harry's older rpms won't run on a newer Mandriva release because of the 
older Fortran libs not being available, nor can the rpms  be rebuilt on 
one from source because of this.

&gt;<i> In the present state of affairs, WSJT on *nix is mainly for 
</I>&gt;<i> developer types ... people who can figure out what's wrong 
</I>&gt;<i> when they get compile-time or runtime error messages.  By

</I>&gt;<i> problem is ... or gradually learn to do some of that 
</I>&gt;<i> programming leg-work yourself.
</I>
I appreciate your efforts Joe, and the efforts of other *nix users on 
the list. With a little help from some of the Linux users, we should be 
able to work through these changes. Diane's changes to the WSPR SVN have 
me almost there on WSPR, and I haven't tackled WSJT yet.

Merging the two sounds interesting.

Mandriva 2008.1
