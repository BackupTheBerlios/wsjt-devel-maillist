I compiled WSJT on Linux yesterday.  It runs fine, no 
problems here.

Yes, this is an older Linux release.  I don't upgrade the 
O/S on my Linux machines frequently; I judge that my &quot;radio 
time&quot; -- even just the software development part of it -- is 
better spent elsewhere.

Almost certainly, the reason for your failure to compile 
WSJT on some new Linux release has to do with the way some 
pre-requisite package is configured.  Since I don't have 
Debian Testing installed anywhere, and since my Ubuntu 
installation is 6.something, I can't say what your problem 
might be.

I make sure that WSJT for Windows runs on nearly 
&quot;everything&quot;.  I don't attempt to do that for every Linux 
distribution; the Linux user-base is far too small to make 
that effort worth my all-volunteer time.

I know of a number of others who have been compiling and 
using recent revisions of WSJT, WSPR, and MAP65 on Linux and 
FreeBSD.  I don't keep track of what &quot;distros&quot; they are 
using, but I suspect they are recent ones.

In the present state of affairs, WSJT on *nix is mainly for 
developer types ... people who can figure out what's wrong 
when they get compile-time or runtime error messages.  By 
all means, you should solicit help to find out what your 
problem is ... or gradually learn to do some of that 
programming leg-work yourself.

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
