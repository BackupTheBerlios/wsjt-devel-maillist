<PRE>Hullo Jonathan,

You write concerning my conversion of .WAV files:
 &gt; Writing endian neutral code isn't difficult. It's a matter of  
reading/writing
 &gt; at the byte level and doing bit shifts...

My strategy in getting WSJT working on a Mac is first to take the  
source code without any modification whatsoever and try to get it to  
work. This means converting files externally such as .WAV files and  
sky temperature files.   This way I can be sure that if problems  
arise they are not due to any errors mistakenly inserted into code by  
me.

Also you note:
 &gt; Just a thought, but shouldn't you be aiming at Mac OS 5.x nowadays

Not necessarily.   WSJT is not a Cocoa/Carbon application but code  
operating at darwin level and therefore essentially unaware of  
differences between 10.4.11 and 10.5.3.   Mentioning OSX 10.4  was  
just a commentary.   The real issue is that I am using Xcode 2.5  
which has the latest compilers and libraries for any OSX release,  
10.4 or 10.5.    The standard 10.5 release contains an old version of  
python (2.5.1) and does not have numpy or scipy or other adjuncts  
required by WSJT.  All these have to be installed anyway.

Current state:  FSK441 and JT65B works.  However, debugging JT6M  
throws up code errors.  (Fortunately) Mac OSX does not zero execution  
memory and therefore the use of undefined variables is exposed and   
causes havoc - ie program crashes.   The problem is finding is  
finding them.  Two such cases have already been found.   Maybe there  
are more.

Now that I have had to jump into the code to fix these,  I have gone  
ahead and installed endian checks in getfile.F90 and astro.f and no  
longer need my converted files.     I agree, endian checks are  
trivial.    Little-endian is just a nasty fact of life.   (Ever tried  
a hex dump of a little endian data file looking for erroneous  
structures?   It's hopeless....)

Have you got WSJT going on your 10.5 Intel?

A final note:  Joe writes in connection with problems reported by  
Harry:     &quot;Software does not break all by itself. &quot;    Yes, indeed.   
I have always argued that software should be called hardware because  
it doesn't break by itself, and hardware should be called software  
because it does.   My hardware colleagues naturally have a different  
point of view....

Thanks for commenting...
