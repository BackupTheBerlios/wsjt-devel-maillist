Nothing found. Then I look for python upgrades. My last JT65B QSO was on
18.June.2008. 10:59-11:21. Then I called long time CQ so WSJT was still
working. But just for any case here is what was updated on 18th of June.
I do not think these upgrades couse the problem:

2008-06-18 10:37:00 upgrade python-glade2 2.12.1-1 2.12.1-6
2008-06-18 10:37:02 upgrade python-gtk2 2.12.1-1 2.12.1-6

Perhaps one of these is because I did not use WSJT since 18th of June
till yesterday when discovered the problem:

2008-06-19 10:15:34 upgrade python-gobject 2.14.1-6 2.14.2-1
2008-06-20 10:54:21 upgrade python-numpy 1:1.0.4-8 1:1.1.0-1

&gt;<i> Well to be fair, you are running Debian testing or unstable which has

</I>&gt;<i> day then the stable release is the answer.
</I>
Yeas I am using Debian Lenny (Testing) which will be the next Debian
Stable. Perhaps I am missing the point. May be the subject of the thread
should be: &quot;Debian Lenny broke my WSJT&quot;. Unfortunately the problems with
wsjt are not connected to Debian only but with all major Linux last
distribution releases. I think wsjt code must be updated according
today's Linux reality. I am sure it will happen. I am patiennt enough to
wait untill developers update their Linux boxes and see the problems. I
just try to save them some time reporting what I've seen. It is not a
problem to use WSJT on elder Linux distribution or as a last posibility
under Windows. (did I say that?).
