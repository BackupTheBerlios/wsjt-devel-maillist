<PRE>I wrote this on 18 June - but it may have been lost.

I am following in the footsteps of Joe Large (W6CQZ; lists 27 Dec  
2007) in trying to get WSJT running on MacOSX 10.4 (PowerPC).   I am  
using source from release 386.    His recipe for compiling was most  
helpful in getting started.   Only minor changes had to be added.     
In addition Nick Repin (VK2ZTY) provided additional help to change  
menus from PC to Mac format.

The sample .WAV files provided in the official release are hybrid big/ 
little endian files and have been converted for big-endian PowerPC  
use.    Successful implementation on a Mac requires that the .WAV  
samples are properly decoded as checked against the WIn32 release  
(386) on a PC running XP.    So far FSK441 mode works.

But JTxx does not.    The KVASD.EXE package is not compiled for a  
PowerPC and therefore the version using the Berlekamp-Massey  
algorithm is automatically selected - see extract.f line 61.   This  
does not decode correctly in that the call signs are not presented.    
Routine decode_rs returns ncount = -1 on every call.

However, if the KVASD.EXE file on the PC is disabled (by renaming the  
file), the official release does not decode properly either.   While  
I understand the development team is running Windows/Linux and  
therefore has the KVASD package running, it would be very helpful if  
the experts could tell me how the official release can be made to  
operate correctly without this package.   It seems to me that it is  
supposed to work.   I might then be able to transfer your solution to  
the Mac version.

Or is the code in extract.f which calls decode_rs now obsolete?   Or,  
another possibility:   is KVASD available compiled for a PowerPC??
