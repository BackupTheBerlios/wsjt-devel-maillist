<PRE>Hullo Diane,

WSJT is now working on the Mac - at least as defined as being able to  
decode correctly all the files in the RxWav/Samples directory  
together with the W8WN_010809_110400.WAV file which is part of the  
release package.    All checked against a PC running r386 but with  
Deep Search enabled as advised by Joe.

I have changed the following files:
wsjt.py:   to insert the menu changes for a Mac (switched if system  
is darwin) as provided by Nick Repin.  I will send his diff file  
which I used.

wsjt1.f   to initialise npkept at the start since this can be  
incremented by decode6m without first having been defined

longx.f   to initialise the dits array since undefined elements cause  
a program crash when the index nc is incorrect when defining the message

four2a.f  to  work correctly with the single-precision FFTW library    
(four2a replaces four2 in the Makefile)

astro.F  to convert TSKY.DAT if CPU is big-endian

getfile.F90  to convert .WAV files if CPU is big-endian

and also changed this code in getfile.F90:

      do i=1,ndata
         n1=d1(i)
         n4=n4+128
         d2c(i)=250*n1
      enddo

n1 (integer*1)  is equivalenced to n4 (integer*4).   This code will  
*only* work correctly on a little-endian CPU.    In the interests of  
open-source, could I suggest that this be replaced by the  
following.   (n4 is not equivalenced to anything.)    This code is  
then endian independent.    (This problem took several days to pin  
down and was the reason that JTxx wouldn't work....)

      do i=1,ndata
         n4=d1(i)
         if (n4.lt.0) n4=256+n4
         d2c(i)=250*n4
      enddo

I will send these files to you directly so you can diff them against  
whichever version you are using, if this is of interest.

Now I can start using it!!
