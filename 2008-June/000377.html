I have the SVN code of WSPR and WSJT working here on Mandriva 2008.1. I 
did have an issue with FTW and the Fortran shims not being correctly 
built in the stock rpms for fftw (thank you Diane), and still haven't 
got any insight about the exact right way to do this from the FFTW 
folks, but both apps run fine here now.

I'd still love to know the correct procedure to build float and double 
precision fftw libs with the type-prefix option, so that default double 
precision can't be reverse affected in any way (maybe it isn't?) The 
original rpms were built without the type-prefix option for either the 
float or the double precision libs. They were built with the Fortran option.

Both WSJT and WSPR were built with gfortran.

Don't know about other distros and any other versions of python. 
Mandriva 2008.1 uses 8.5.

Incidentally, I also security update Linux almost every day, and can 
easily roll back any changes that updating process makes under Linux, 
something I can't easily do under Windows. I'm not seeing any 
deleterious effects from the Mandriva security updates. However, unlike 
some distros, Mandriva only ships security updates to a released distro. 
There are no inline OS or application updates to later versions of code 
than originally shipped, these occur twice a year. (Or can be forced at 
your own risk via a backports repository from the devel version of the 
OS code.)
