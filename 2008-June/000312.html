<PRE>Hi Bruce,

Now, on your other question ...

&gt;<i> Joe, what's your direction here?  You seem to be mostly working to  
</I>&gt;<i> incorporate the WSPR mode into mainline WSJT for QSO purposes.  WIll  
</I>&gt;<i> WPSR standalone also have the QSO features (partially implemented, at  
</I>&gt;<i> least in terms of UI), or will it be just for the current beacon model  
</I>&gt;<i> + best DX, or folded entirely into WSJT?  Just trying to set my  
</I>&gt;<i> priorities...some things like web uploading are broken in the latest  
</I>&gt;<i> branches/wspr, as you are putting a subset of fields into  
</I>&gt;<i> decoded.txt.  Easy to fix if that is heading toward release, but it  
</I>&gt;<i> wasn't clear with the QSO stuff going into WSJT.
</I>
Yes, my recent work has been toward putting the WSPR QSO 
mode, and possibly another new EME-optimized mode, into WSJT 
for QSO purposes.  The standalone WSPR will be able to 
receive the QSO-mode WSPR messages but will not transmit them.

The three checkboxes and &quot;Tx msg&quot; box in the status bar were 
a bare-bones method of enabling a few WSPR QSOs for test 
purposes.  They would be inconvenient and error-prone for 
general use, however, and will be removed.

I had forgotten that a few items removed from decoded.txt, 
even though not needed or useful on-screen, are used for web 
uploading.  They will have to be replaced before WSPR is 
released again.  As you say, this will be easy to do.

	-- Joe
