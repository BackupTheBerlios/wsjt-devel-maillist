No worries Joe. I have plenty of time, and we all know you are busy.

I was hoping to get clarification from the FFTW folks, but haven't heard back 
from them.

It may be as simple as adding the type-prefix switch at compile time, but I 
want to make sure I don't inadvertently break the normal double precision 
usage for most of the other apps that use FFTW. I've only done the 
single/double precision build on one test machine here. I'm saving the rest 
of the boxes for a virgin update with the approved code, so I know it'll work 
for others no surprises.

The FFTW site recommended this:

./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-type-prefix --enable-shared
make
make install
make clean
./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-float --enable-type-prefix 
--enable-shared
make
make install

Mandriva built it minus the --enable-type-prefix option, though they added 
the --enable-fortran, which should have been enabled by default anyway, as 
long as there was a FORTRAN compiler found.

I'm curious how the debian/*buntu folks build their packages, and whether the 
above if the preferred way to run single and double precision libs on a 
single system.

No hurry. 

Thanks for all your hard work Joe :)

Rick Kunath, k9ao
