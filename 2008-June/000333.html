<PRE>Harry et al.,

Don't worry, there is a commitment by some of us to make sure it works  
on linux (and I would really like to get it building and working on OS  
X as well).  As as approach a new release, it's important to me to  
make sure it's works in these environments.  As we approach a release,  
I will try to make sure it builds and runs successfully on at least  
one modern linux (ubuntu 8 is what I run).

IIRC, though it got the segfaults out of the box, I was able to get  
the stock version to build and run correctly by doing an &quot;apt-get  
source wsjt&quot; and dpkg-buildpackage and re-installing it.  I'll verify  
that next week when I get back home.  It's been a month or two since  
I've done that, as I've been working in the dev world.

Hammish may know more about the debian/ubuntu status.

</I>&gt;<i> And this is reproduced with all revisions since the last stable  
</I>&gt;<i> r385. We
</I>&gt;<i> can not make new binaryes until segmentation fault disappear.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In the last r845 ./configure was changed, perhaps, and g95 was

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I see. WSJT is working on developers machines under Linux. But it is

</I>&gt;<i> working on the users machines. This is what I reported. I do not
</I>&gt;<i> complain. Just a question. How should you know that there is a problem
</I>&gt;<i> in this case if we do not report?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes I need Linux WSJT but I can always install older Linux  
</I>&gt;<i> distribution
</I>&gt;<i> just to use WSJT during my next MS expedition. But I think modern
</I>&gt;<i> distributions are dhe feature and WSJT code should be adapted. At the
</I>&gt;<i> present time WSJT simply does not work on them. Again I do not  
</I>&gt;<i> complain.
</I>&gt;<i> I just report willing to help in some way.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I express my deap respect to all the team for their effort and time

</I>&gt;<i> are minority and do not pay the effort. It hurts but is the reality.
