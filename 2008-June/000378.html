<PRE>Harry --

&gt;<i> I sopose you have switched ON your Windows Updates. 
</I>
No, definitely NOT on my development machine, or on my shack computer. I
have an independent security firewall, and I don't want Microsoft or
anybody else messing with the installed OS on my &quot;work&quot; machine, either
Windows or Linux.

&gt;<i> The same is here
</I>&gt;<i> with Linux. I need at least security updates. The difference is that
</I>&gt;<i> Microsoft is slow with updates and you do not have every day procedure.
</I>&gt;<i> Linux society is quick and we updade more often. BTW Linux is in process
</I>&gt;<i> of major upgrade right now. Especially Python. I do alarm developers
</I>&gt;<i> team that WSJT is no more usable on Linux systems. I am not gilty about
</I>&gt;<i> this Linux upgrade process. I do not cpmplain, just send my report. IMHO
</I>&gt;<i> the WSJT code is reaslly working on developers machines only right now.
</I>&gt;<i> Please update your Linux systems! You will have another point of
</I>&gt;<i> view. :)
</I>
I use Linux for much of my development work.  The contributions I make
are in the areas of weak-signal algorithms and their implementation, not
in problems related to an updated OS or other system software.

I want the resulting programs to be useful to many people, so I produce
installable packages that run without problems on Windows.  I make sure
that the programs also run without problems on my Linux installations.

Others have graciously pitched in to make installable *nix packages,
which is great.  These packages generally work fine ... until you break
something by installing some &quot;latest update&quot; on your machine.

As I said, if you want to play computers, OK ...; but if you want to
have a stable base on which to run a complex program with many demands
on the OS, you'll need to (1) operate differently, (2) learn to fix what
your updates broke, or (3) be patient and wait for someone else to find
time to address your problem.

Among the WSJT, MAP65, and WSPR users I know about who run the programs
on one flavor or another of *nix, most seem quite ablt to keep the
program running smoothly and to be happy with their choice or OS.
