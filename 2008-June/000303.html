<PRE>As I reported earlier WSJT Deb packages do not work in Debian Testing
and Ubuntu since a long time. WSJT can not compile on Debian Testing,
Ubuntu and Mandriva. So what changed so dramatically in the newest
distribution releases? What broke so briliant working code?

I solved my personal problem by converting rpm to deb using alien. It
worked fine until the last night. As Debian rejected all compilers
except gfortran libg2c.so.0 was removed too and my package stopped
working.

I tried to compile WSJT but always error. Next I removed python-f2py and
installed python-numpy. After that WSJT compiles fine by gfortran. But
always after starting the program I get crash and &quot;segmentation fault&quot;
error. Next I tried to compile with g95. It compiled and started fine
but Period ID Name in main interface is always 000000.

This segmentation fault was reported many times by Ubuntu users too.
Ubuntu users reported nonworking deb of WSJT also. It rare worked only
to those who did not make fresh install but upgraded their distributions
to the last Ubuntu release.

Please can you look at the code. It is sad to have no chance to use WSJT
on air now when a good meteor showers are comming. As WSJT is no more
working on Ubuntu, Debian and Mandriva I think it is not usable under
Linux any more. Except rare cases where people keeps old versions of
some libraries  and/or compilers on their machines. But I am sure WSJT
does not work on the mentioned distributions if they were fresh
installed.

I must say all said above concernes wsjt 5.9.7r385 the last official
wsjt release. 

73, Harry LZ1BB
