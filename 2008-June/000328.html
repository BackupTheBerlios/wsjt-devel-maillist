As Joe said, the head of the tree is going to be unstable.

&quot;Dear Colleagues,

A brief reminder: I wrote about a week ago to let you know
that code in the WSJT trunk repository would be unstable for
a bit.  I am in the process of adding WSPR and possibly
another yet-to-be-named mode to the list of supported modes
in WSJT.

If you need to compile a stable version of WSJT, I suggest
checking out a revision no later than 789.

        -- 73, Joe, K1JT
&quot;

I am simply wanting to check it configures and compiles for
other users, stability is another problem.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately ./configure --enable-g95 does not work. Again gfortran
</I>
You don't have g95 installed.

&gt;<i> with the segmentation fault. Can you seriously look at the code, Diane?
</I>
Sure, but you really haven't given me enough information to go on.
What mode are you running wsjt in? etc. etc.? If I can I will look
at stability problems while Joe is away, but there is no guarantee
I can fix it.

&gt;<i> Joe said that Linux users are minority and do not pay the effort. This
</I>&gt;<i> is sad to hear about.
</I>
How do you think I feel, FreeBSD didn't even get mentioned. ;-)
Seriously, it's not just linux, BSD is also in the form of OSX.
I will grudgingly accept the term unix to mean linux and FreeBSD, though
FreeBSD has a direct lineage to the original Unix (TM) and Linux does not. ;-)

If I see a stability problem with FreeBSD, or you can tell me how
to replicate one, I will fix if I can. ok? If you see a core file
and can get a gdb bt on it, that would also be useful.

We _know_ the head of the tree is going to be unstable, I am sure
we must have a few array bounds problems. If you need a stable version,
do as Joe suggests and use a revision no later than 789.

P.S. I have wsjt sitting here compiled with g95 in wspr mode, it has
been quite stable for a while monitoring.
