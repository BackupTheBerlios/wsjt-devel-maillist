Dear friends,

Let me explain. I do not complain. I joined the team as beta tester and
active operator. So I just report what I find wrong. So will repeat.
Several fortran libraries were rejected from all last GNU/Linux
distribution releases. WSJT does not work any more. I agree Linux users
are minority compared with Windows users. But majority Linux users use
Ubuntu, Debian, Mandriva, Fedora. After fortran library rejection the
ready made deb and rpm binarys do not work any more. That why I said
WSJT is no more usable under Linux. I was talking for the last stable
release r385 (the same as 383 just a dummy).

Which is the worst. New compilation is succesfull but WSJT crashes with
segmentation fault when compiled with gfortran. Little success with g95.
And this is reproduced with all revisions since the last stable r385. We
can not make new binaryes until segmentation fault disappear.

In the last r845 ./configure was changed, perhaps, and g95 was unusable
any more. Diane asked a question about r844 and I tryed to answer. It
was a report, not complain.

I see. WSJT is working on developers machines under Linux. But it is not
working on the users machines. This is what I reported. I do not
complain. Just a question. How should you know that there is a problem
in this case if we do not report?

Yes I need Linux WSJT but I can always install older Linux distribution
just to use WSJT during my next MS expedition. But I think modern
distributions are dhe feature and WSJT code should be adapted. At the
present time WSJT simply does not work on them. Again I do not complain.
I just report willing to help in some way.

I express my deap respect to all the team for their effort and time
spent toward WSJT development. Yes it was sad to hear that Linux users
are minority and do not pay the effort. It hurts but is the reality. We
have been accustomed to hear this already.

As you see my English is quite spare and limited. Perhaps this is the
reason I can not express my reports in the best way.

Thanks for reading and understanding.

73, Harry LZ1BB
