<PRE>Does anyone have WSPR working compiled with gfortran?  It compiles  
after fixing the configure.ac to remove the -ftrace=full, which isn't  
an option on gfortran (just g95 AFAIK).

However, the spectrum display doesn't work, as gfortran doesn't seem  
to support either form='binary' or access='stream' used by spec162.f.   
I'm not a fortran expert, so rather than flail around trying things, I  
figured I would ask here.  In my sandbox, I've also changed  
configure.ac to prefer g95 if available rather than preferring  
gfortran; I decided to wait to check in those changes until resolving  
this.

Meanwhile, speaking of flailing, I have been trying to get it to work  
under Mac OS X, and failing miserably.  I can get it to compile using  
python25, but I get nasty messages about python trying to free memory  
blocks with unaligned pointers while in Pmw code.  f2py for python24  
in macports doesn't work correctly.  But that's another problem for  
another day.

Joe, what's your direction here?  You seem to be mostly working to  
incorporate the WSPR mode into mainline WSJT for QSO purposes.  WIll  
WPSR standalone also have the QSO features (partially implemented, at  
least in terms of UI), or will it be just for the current beacon model  
+ best DX, or folded entirely into WSJT?  Just trying to set my  
priorities...some things like web uploading are broken in the latest  
branches/wspr, as you are putting a subset of fields into  
decoded.txt.  Easy to fix if that is heading toward release, but it  
wasn't clear with the QSO stuff going into WSJT.
