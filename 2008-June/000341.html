Checked out 845, configured with just the g95 switch, built and get this:

python wsjt.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
   File &quot;wsjt.py&quot;, line 11, in &lt;module&gt;
     from WsjtMod import Audio
ImportError: /home/rick/SVN/wsjt/trunk/WsjtMod/Audio.so: undefined 
symbol: sfftw_execute__

I dod see a few other compiler complaints, scrolled by pretty fast.
