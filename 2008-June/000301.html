<PRE>I reproduced the problem in Debian Testing too. WSJT compiles. But when
started I see program interface for a while and program crashes. No
error messages except &quot;segmentation fault&quot;. This is while wsjt is
compiled with gfortran. If I compile with g95 then it compiles and start
fine. But period id name in main interface is always with name 00000.

BTW several Ubuntu users reported segmentation error while compiling
with gfortran. They reported wsjt deb is not working after fresh Ubuntu
install. It worked ONLY if distro-uppgrade was performed to upgrade to
next Ubuntu release.

BTW WSJT Deb is *NOT* working in Debian Testing since a long time. I
reported but there was not any attention. It broked after an update. But
I can not remember what was updated. Not working since then.
