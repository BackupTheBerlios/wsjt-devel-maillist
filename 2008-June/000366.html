<PRE>I've been working on getting WSJT/WSPR SVN to build on Mandriva 2008.1 
here, and have had success finally. Special thanks to Diane Bruce, who 
helped me identify that the single precision FFTW Fortran shims weren't 
built correctly in the Mandriva rpm.

I have been trying to get something solid from the FFTW folks, but no 
response in quite a while. What I'm trying to determine, is what is the 
correct way to build these libs for double and single precision while 
maintaining compatibility for other apps that were build expecting the 
normal double precision behavior?

The FFTW web man page suggests this as the way to build double and 
single precision libs on the same system:

./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-type-prefix --enable-shared
make
make install
make clean

./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-float --enable-type-prefix 
--enable-shared
make
make install

The Mandriva 2008.1 rpms were built like this except that the 
--enable-type-prefix was omitted from both the single and the double 
precision builds. On the Mandriva builds the --enable-fortran option was 
also included on both builds. I did rebuild the stock FFTW srpms on my 
machine (that has gfortran and g95 installed) just to be sure, but no 
Fortran shims were built. It wasn't until I built using the type-prefix 
commands that I was able to build WSJT/WSPR SVN successfully on a test 
machine. What I am trying to determine is what is the correct order to 
build these, if it matters, and what needs to be done to make sure the 
normal compatibility with default double precision libs building still 
works.

I'm hoping folks on the list might be able to shed some light on this 
for me base don what works and has been tested on other distros.

Thanks in advance to all who have helped me so much.
