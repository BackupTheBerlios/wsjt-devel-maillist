</I>Their intent, I believe, is that tags should not be branches (despite 
the fact that tags and branches in SVN are implemented the same way). 
They would become so if commits were allowed to tags. They do go on to 
say that some sites use commit hooks to physically ban commits to 
anything under tags, we don't need that but the concept is important 
because it allows a tag to be named the same as the branch it snapshots. 
That way you can create a branch called, say wsjtx-1.3.1, and commit 
away to it while developing; but the tag wsjtx-1.3.1 is a snapshot of 
what actually went out of the door after development was completed and 
should not change.

So summarising:

A branch represents a future release.
A tag represents what was actually released (other minor milestones can 
be tagged too like release candidates).

</I>&gt;<i> But of course: Yes, we can do it the way you suggest, if everyone 
</I>&gt;<i> prefers.
