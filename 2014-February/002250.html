<PRE>Greg et al,

Here's what I found:

1) chrome users need to disable malware and fishing protection before doing
your download else it's flagged as malicious and stops

2)  unzip of the first file creates ..\Downloads\wsjt-doc\wsjt-doc with
wsjt-setup.bat inside.

3) on the first try, download of cygwin 64 landed in c:\cygwin. after
launching that I got many popups asking what source server to use, what
files I wanted, LibUSB-Win32 driver was missing but I could get it from
sourceforge, and that I needed the win native version of Bonjour.

4)  I deleted it all and started over, being careful to put cygwin in
..\Downloads\wsjt-docs\wsjt-docs. setup batch file then ran as advertised.

5) running wsjt-doc-setup ran to completion with no errors seen

6) wsjt-doc.bat terminated with &quot;/usr/bin/svn.exe: error while loading
shared libraries cannot open shared object file: no such file or directory&quot;
( I used both the corrected svn path..../wsjt/doc and the
corrected-corrected path .../branches/doc ) with same result

7)    reboot didn't help

8) I have a very fast cable modem connection so i don't think timeouts were
an issue

When I earlier queried Joe about the wsjt-x installer defaulting to
c:\wsjtx his explanation was that versions of windows later than XP might
not grant appropriate rights to make install go smoothly. Could this be
related?  If so a rework of the batch files to make sure everything lands
in c:\wsjt would be a good idea.

Also, if you make and corrections to your instructions would you start over
with a new post that goes step by step?   It's too easy to make a mistake
flipping back and forth between diffs.

hope this is of some use, chuck
