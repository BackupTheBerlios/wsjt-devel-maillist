<PRE>Hello,

I just joined the list so let me introduce myself. My name is Richard Shaw
(KF5OIM) and I've been a Fedora (and RPM Fusion) packager for a few years
now. I'm also the current maintainer for other ham related packages such as
FLDIgi and QSSTV for Fedora.

I would like to package wsjtx for Fedora and I'm sure this is nothing new
to those here, but the current install is incompatible with the Fedora
packaging guidelines.

I started with version 1.2 some time ago and gave up as I'm not much of a
programmer and ran into some issues I couldn't rectify. I see with the
proposed 1.3 release that the cmake build now at least has an install
target even if most everything is dumped in /usr/bin, which is the main
reason for my post.

In an attempt to get 1.2 to play nice with linux, I tried doing some QT/c++
hacking to the code and although what I have should NOT be checked in, but
there may be some useful bits in it, most notably changing from doing
everything relative to the wsjtx binary location to a home directory
approach.

Some questions I still have is about the function of the Palettes and save
directories? Are they intended to be writable? Or static? Are they arch
independent?

The answers to those questions would help me to understand the most
appropriate location for those files in a the linux/FHS world.

Here is a link to my patch attempt if it helps:

Thanks,
Richard
