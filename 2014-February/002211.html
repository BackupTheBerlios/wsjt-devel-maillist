</I>
Somewhere around WSJT-X r3500 we stopped sending spots to PSK Reporter 
using the DLL written by Philip Gladstone, author of PSK Reporter, and 
started using our own code written by Edson, PY2SDR.

&gt;<i> The reason I ask is, would it be possible to add the reporting
</I>&gt;<i> OS/Agent, Darwin, Windows, Linux etc, to the psk-reports and have it
</I>&gt;<i> render in usage statistics? I think this could help prioritize tasks
</I>&gt;<i> that have the largest impact on the user base, even though everyone
</I>&gt;<i> does not use the psk-reporter function.
</I>
Yes, I think this should be possible.  Maybe Edson has an opinion.

&gt;<i> In the meantime, I'm adding four additional VM's to to test with,
</I>&gt;<i> FreeBSD, Arch, Fedora and Slackware. According to Distro-Watch, Mint
</I>&gt;<i> has become fairly popular, but that should follow along with Debian
</I>&gt;<i> and Ubuntu in terms of installation, package maintenance and source
</I>&gt;<i> build testing. According to IDC, Gartner etc, WinXP is second to Win7
</I>&gt;<i> but surely that will change when XP goes EOL in a few months time. I
</I>&gt;<i> suspect, in the not so distant future, more issues will arise form
</I>&gt;<i> Win7/8 than XP. Should we be focused on Win7 as the primary use platform?
</I>
Yes, I think the majority of our user base is Win7/8.

&gt;<i> Would it make sense to have a blueprint of sorts for testing a core
</I>&gt;<i> list of OS / Distro's combinations before a formal release? Obviously
</I>&gt;<i> this should be a short list, but, could provide some valuable data to
</I>&gt;<i> developers.
</I>
Sounds reasonable to me.
