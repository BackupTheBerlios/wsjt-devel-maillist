<PRE>I've been using a TenTec model 516, the so-called Argonaut 5 and the
recommended Prolific USB/serial adapter. So, I use a com port setup for rig
cat but set  PTT for rig cat as well.  I can also use a com port for PTT
via the USB/Serial logic in the Prolific.   I've logged several qsls with
this setup.

So all seems ok except I'm not sure about split mode.

facts:

On my setup wsjtx split mode causes selected bands to get assigned
frequencies consistently, with 2Khz spread between VFOA and VFOB for HF
bands  .

If I select split mode on the rig as well only vfoa is changed during band
selection.

I get the concept of stacking two vfos with freq offsets side by side to
get greater effective bandwidth but can't  get past that point.

Some questions:

1) My receive bandwidth knob gives me up to 3000hz for all HF bands..
Does this mean I might have as much as 5000Hz receive bandwidth if the
split mode feature works (as I think it might) on my rig?

2) The wsjtx manual talks about 500Hz offsets for transmit with split
enabled. Would somebody please elaborate on that as I don't follow
precisely how it works?

 3) Am I confusing conventional rig spit mode with the wsjt-x feature AKA
spit mode?

4) Is rig cat planned to set USB mode?  My programmer's manual shows this
as accessible via an ascii string which uses a different command syntax
than the other rig cat commands.  The workaround for split is to manually
set each vfo on each band to USB before launching wsjtx.  Livable for now.

5)  With wstx split enabled I select a jt9 freq of 3772 and send CQ. The
rig generates RF out and the displayed frequency is 3772. Is that really
happening or do I need to look at the rig RF/AF output with a scope to
confirm?

thanks in advance for your answers
