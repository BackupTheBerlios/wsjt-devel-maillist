<PRE>Hi all.

As some of you may know from a previous posting, I am working on a new
program for operating JT65 with a primary focus upon its use in the HF
Bands.  The program is now in alpha testing with (at this writing) 33 users
participating in its testing.  Many bugs have been found and squashed, but,
one issue that's come to light is that of exceeding the dB level that can be
expressed in a compacted JT65 exchange.

While not a concern when dealing with JT65 in its primary role of an EME
mode where signal levels would not be expected to even approach 0, let alone
go positive, it is a problem seen with the stronger levels seen on HF.
While generally rare, it's not unusual to see levels reported at 0, 1 or
2dB.  Of the ~1.7 million spots contained in my database I have about 7000
reported at &gt; -01dB.  Admittedly not a huge number, about .4%.

Since confirming that reports &gt; -01 are sent as free text (often yielding
the dreaded call sign pair only exchanges seen on HF) I have within my code
placed a hard limit of -01 for the maximum signal report and would like to
propose something similar for WSJT and other programs implementing the JT65
protocol.  This would prevent the excursions into undefined territory.  Of
course, it could also be left to the operator of WSJT to manually edit the
report, but, not all users realize they're not really transmitting what is
shown in the tx msg boxes or pay attention to the actual TX message as
display in WSJT's lower right corner.  It makes no sense to modify the
protocol to send &gt; -01dB reports as it's seldom seen thus my proposal of the
hard limit of -01.

Just an idea, perhaps it makes sense, perhaps it doesn't.
