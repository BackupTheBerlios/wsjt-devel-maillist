Hi Joe

&gt;<i>As far as I can see, it does just what I said it would do.  In line 943 
</I>&gt;<i>delete 5 spaces before &quot;dB&quot;, 4 before &quot;DT&quot;, 3 before &quot;Freq, and 8 before 
</I>&gt;<i>&quot;Drift&quot;.  In line 944 change the constant 150 to 123.  The column 
</I>&gt;<i>headings will then be neatly aligned.  Nothing moves West when I tell it 
</I>&gt;<i>to move East.  It behaves just as expected.
</I>
Yep I tried all the deleting of spaces. Changing the constant 150 to 123,
123 was the figure I came up with too. That fixes it for the Screen
resolution and geometry which you have and me too.

Each Linux release will need the constant changed after compile because it
is a fixed value, and the geometry of the GUI varies. Plus when run on a
high resolution monitor it changes again.
The value is obviously OK for MS Windows. 
 
Being nomadic as described it needs to be anchored. As I said I expected
that some Python'ite would have a simple answer.

&gt;<i>Nothing moves West when I tell it to move East.  It behaves just as
</I>expected.

In true experimental fashion I tried instead of anchor 'w', anchor 'e', the
text wraps round and appears on the west. I tried anchor center and it
moves to the west. Needing to describe that effect, I said it makes the
Label appear to be outside the frame.

I tried giving the label  a widget to anchor to, that works but the label
is still mobile varying with geometry. The only way I could see of giving
it a position that will not change with GUI size is to fix it 'e' pad it
and move the 'Decoded text' box with it.

What I described places the label in the same position in the same frame as
the box it is labelling, wise? Any itinerant behaviour is thus cured. Yes
it is merely a personal mod.

&gt;<i>Of course you should feel free to modify the code for your own use, 
</I>&gt;<i>however you see fit.
</I>
Yes and interesting too.

&gt;<i>I don't know of any reasonable way to make these things 
</I>&gt;<i>fully platform- and font-independent.
</I>
It is a fact surely that this odd bit of incompatibility with MS Windows
will effect everyone who compiles for Linux. I described a way of fixing
it, I am sure there are other probably better ways too.

If that was fixed the  WSPR GUI would be platform and font independent
across a dozen different Linux distros as tested at this QTH and in
Denmark. Pretty good I recon.

OK enough said on the subject.
