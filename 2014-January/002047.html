</I>&gt;<i>         Hello Joe,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         Compiled clean and running without issues on Ubuntu 12.04. I
</I>&gt;<i>         had to add a few missing entries to lib/CMakeLists.txt.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>         I've added a call to PSK_Reporter::sendSpots() in
</I>&gt;<i>         MainWindow::on_bandComboBox_activated() to flush spots to
</I>&gt;<i>         PSKReporter before changing bands. This should prevent spots
</I>&gt;<i>         being reported on the wrong band.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     I'm not sure this change achieves the desired behaviour in all
</I>&gt;<i>     cases. Decodes are effectively buffered in the audio input buffers
</I>&gt;<i>     so there is nothing to flush from the current period when a band
</I>&gt;<i>     change is made.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> That is very true indeed.
</I>Looking at the PSKReporter spot queue in WSJT-X it seems that queue 
entries contain a frequency so I believe  there is no implicit problem 
with entries in the queue so long as they are added with a correct 
frequency.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     It may also be necessary to discard all spots destined for
</I>&gt;<i>     PSKReporter that are decoded in a period where the Rx dial
</I>&gt;<i>     frequency has changed either by the band dropdown or by the rig
</I>&gt;<i>     VFO knob.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes. I am wandering how to best (read easier) way to implement this. 
</I>&gt;<i> One possibility is to flag the audio detector object when there is a 
</I>&gt;<i> band change. In this case when the buffer is full, it will discard the 
</I>&gt;<i> buffer -- by not calling the detector. This way we could assure that a 
</I>&gt;<i> corrupt buffer will not cause issues. What do you think?
</I>I'm not sure that disabling decoding is a good thing, spots are 
transient information and discarding a few doubtful ones is not an issue 
for me, but discarding decodes is another matter. For example if that 
rare one gets decoded, just as I arrive on a band or just after a leave 
a band, I want to know about it even if I have moved. It may not be 
feasible to give the correct frequency for a decode but it is still 
useful information. Not having certainty about frequency makes it poor 
spot information, but I know I've just moved, I can use the decode 
information.

I would keep a &quot;valid&quot; flag that is set at the start of each period and 
reset whenever a band/dial frequency is detected. Then only add new 
decodes to the PSKReporter spot queue when the flag is set. 
Unfortunately the decoding process is asynchronous and can continue into 
the subsequent period  to that which the message was sent. This last 
fact makes it quite difficult to time the setting and resetting of any 
such flag :(
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     The situation with Hamspots via JTAlert is more complex since the
</I>&gt;<i>     decodes are used for more than just spotting so it would be rather
</I>&gt;<i>     unhelpful to block all decodes going to JTAlert from a period that
</I>&gt;<i>     the dial frequency changed in.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am not familiar with JTAlert -- Lnux user here. One thing that has 
</I>&gt;<i> crossed my mind is that the band info could be written along with each 
</I>&gt;<i> spot to ALL.TXT and decoded.txt. This way the spots could be post 
</I>&gt;<i> processed and the band info would be readily available. What do you think?
</I>As discussed above, the frequency of a decode is not always certain. If 
we were to export the state of the &quot;valid&quot; flag I suggest above along 
with each decode; then JTAlert or any other user of the decoded info 
could know the certainty of the frequency.
