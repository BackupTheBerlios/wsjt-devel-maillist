<PRE>The lower third of the Wide Graph window where the spectral display is
located is not very efficiently used.  Currently I typically have my Wide
Graph sized at approximately 1000 x 900 pixels and the spectrum display does
indeed take about a third of that.  (The documentation calls this the lower
third!)

This is divided into 7 segments (six horizontal lines).  In this new version
(with the flatten feature unchecked) my noise floor typically sits at or a
bit under the lowest of the horizontal lines ... and signals may peak at the
next horizontal line above that (loudest ones).  In essence I'm only using
the lower third of the lower third - and there's a lot of wasted screen
space.   Note: when the flatten box is checked everything moves up a
line/division - but there's still a lot of wasted space.

Is there a way to make more efficient use of screen real-estate?  While
multiple monitors are prevalent there never seems to be enough space for all
the windows ...

Screen snippet attached (the loudest JT65 peaks there were decoded at a -1
dB).
