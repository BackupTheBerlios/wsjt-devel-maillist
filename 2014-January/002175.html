<PRE>Hi John,

I don't see that a separate SVN branch for documentation would help 
much, since commits to *any* branch of the WSJT project increment the 
revision number as far as SVN is concerned.

However, it might help to make it a policy not to make changes to both 
code and documentation in the same &quot;commit&quot;.  In addition, we could make 
it a policy to make a token change to mainwindow.cpp (so it will &quot;know&quot; 
the new revision number) only when making other code changes.

Then, even when there have been subsequent documentation-only updates, 
the compiled program would still bear the revision number of the last 
*code* update.  Does this make sense?

	-- Joe, K1JT

</I>&gt;<i> This would separate changes to documentation from changes to actual code.   The advantage would be in dealing with reports from someone having difficulty with r3150 (an invented rev) when this in fact has the same code as in r3100 and the revision changes have had nothing to do with code changes but documentation.    It would be necessary for anyone wanting to deal with this report to download r3150, compile and test, only to discover that the current code revision is really r3100 - or ask the reporter to update code to r3150 and try again.      It seems to me that having revision numbers tied only to actual code changes would aid code maintenance.
