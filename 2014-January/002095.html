<PRE>Previously been using 3590 with good results.  Downloaded 3644 and installed
to same directory that 3590 was in.

For some reason on first launch had issue with CAT - error said couldn't
read and then catEnabled was changed to false in the ini file.  This
happened twice (two different launches of the program).  Recurs but not
necessarily reproducible.  CAT and PTT are two virtual COM ports to a
microKEYER II - USB device router 8.5.2.  (Never had any rig access /
control problems with 3590.)

By default new parameter flatten=true was set.  My waterfall was nothing but
bright red (I prefer blue!) ... and no green line on the bottom of the Wide
Graph.  Unchecking the Flatten box restored the waterfall to what it
previously worked like - except the slope value that I had previously set
obviously wasn't / isn't being used.  Audio is from FTDX5000 4.00 kHz width
through microKEYER II audio interface.

(Please let me know if this is the correct place and manner to provide this
kind of feedback to the development team.)
