<PRE>Hi Bob, All,

Just this morning I sent Joe a couple of WAV files that cause a hang (r3659 WinXP).
The WAVs are lousy, I was fixing an audio cable fault between radio and PC.
I consider them to be an extreme bad audio files, very quiet with clicks and pops etc.
However, trying to decode them hangs WSJTX.

When it hung, the decode button stayed green, waterfall stopped.
The File menu would work but the options to open a file were greyed out.
Clicking on the X top right closed it.

Dosnt sound quite like the same hang you experienced ?

Cheers David

  WSJT-X v1.2.2 r3659 on 64-bit Windows 7

   

  Left the application open / running on my system overnight with rig tuned to 7.076 MHz.  Found it hung / Not Responding this morning when I looked at the system.  No other applications (other than what normally runs in the background) were open at the time.

   

  The last decode was 05:02Z and the waterfall shows probably the full 48 seconds of 05:03Z (but no decodes) when it hung.  It created a 140126_0503.wav file but size is zero.

   

  Task manager shows:

   

  wsjt.exe 39,216 K

  jt9.exe 3,176 K

   

  Killed the JT9 process - main program still hung.  Attempting to close (red X window control) either the main WSJT-X or Wide Graph window didn't end the program - had to choose &quot;close the program&quot;.

   

  Restarted the program and works just fine.

  Not sure if attachments are allowed on this list - I have a couple of screen shots - I'll try to attach them as a reply to this message to keep it in the same thread once this makes it to the list.
