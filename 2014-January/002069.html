<PRE>Sent this to the &quot;other&quot; list, probably an error. I seek a comment or
two. I'm not a really great programmer, a physics model or two in the
longago, but I'm willing to struggle with this.
For a couple of reasons, I'd like to modify the wsjt code (hopefully the
latest) to output a single rs232 character, really an 8-bit binary that
has the value, somehow, of the current modulation tone frequency as the
transmit signal is developed. I think that there's already an open rs232
protocol to get the ptt out. So the transmit frequency followed by a
sequence of tone values could be sent on that port at a whacking great
baudrate. There would be no modification to any of the other code, as
the soundcard line output could proceed as usual. I'd like to be able to
do direct frequency output. There are a big host of sdr receive nodules
out there, but almost all of them simply ignore transmit.  Doing an ssb
transmit chain for an inherently simple signal when there are lots of
dds modules, etc that can be directly driven , and that there has to be
a t/r chain controller anyway, seems like a lot of trouble. Of course,
the zero frequency may have to be independently set.
I seem to remember reading that the transmit tone does change value on a
zero crossing, and that may be somewhat of a problem.
Completely whacky, doable easily, or in between?
Don
