<PRE>&gt;<i> &gt; Is there a link to a build newer than 3644?  (I think I read a 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; message about such a build but I deleted the message.)  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; I continue to run 3590 but would be glad to jump to a newer version.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Not sure what you're after, here.  Of course, 3644 is newer that 3590.
</I>&gt;<i> In an earlier message to wsjt-devel I included a link to a package for
</I>&gt;<i> r3644:
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJTX_122r3644.exe">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJTX_122r3644.exe</A>
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> If you want something later than that, e.g. from the HEAD of the SVN
</I>&gt;<i> repository, you need to compile it yourself.
</I>
Although I subscribed to a couple of the WSJT lists some time ago I have not
been actively reading the messages ... and recently attempted to go through
some 3,500+ catching up.  I probably messed up in my notes of the build
numbers - I'll pull down the 3644 for now.

---

&gt;<i> &gt; My gut feeling is the crashes were attributed to something 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; being decoded being sent by a specific station as it was fairly 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; consistent for a period of time that I was operating (normally 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; evenings UTC-0500 on 7.076 MHz) - QSY or going QRT and coming 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; back later never had the problem.  And FWIW - I have not seen 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; a crash now in some time.  (Offending station not being heard?!)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I think it unlikely that a decoded message could trigger a program
</I>&gt;<i> crash.  But if it did -- and certainly I have been surprised before! --
</I>&gt;<i> the corresponding recorded *.wav file should cause the same 
</I>&gt;<i> misbehavior.   I would welcome receipt of such a *.wav file.
</I>
Though I've not seen any issues (crashes) recently I'll turn on recording in
the event I can capture something if it does happen.

Looking back through my notes - it would appear that the crash had occurred
a number of times whilst in QSO with someone.  The crash always occurred
after the period of reception (after second 47/48).  I can't say if it
happened at the point where it was my turn to transmit.  I'm trying to
remember if the crash occurred while just sitting monitoring the band /
reporting to PSK ... but can't say for certain.

When it was crashing I did restart the application and turn off the PSK
reporting thinking that may have been related to the problem - it still
crashed even with that off.
