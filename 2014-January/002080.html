Further to Joe's reply, a couple more points.

</I>&gt;<i> The program writes logs, saved *.wav files, wsjtx.ini, and other 
</I>&gt;<i> things in the installation directory.  (Some further details can be 
</I>&gt;<i> found at the bottom of page 25 in the online User's Guide.)  By 
</I>&gt;<i> default, Vista and later versions of Windows don't give ordinary users 
</I>&gt;<i> write permission in subdirectories of &quot;C:\Program Files&quot;.
</I>Installing software into &quot;\Program Files&quot; or &quot;\Program Files (x86)&quot; that 
is not specifically designed to be installed there usually leads to a 
whole lot of issues. The reason is that software that resides there is 
may not write to the install directory without elevated  privileges 
(WSJT-X does write to its install directory), that in turn means that 
other software cannot interact with the installed program without itself 
having elevated privileges. This knock on effect is highly undesirable 
as running programs with elevated privileges is inherently dangerous 
since it introduces an opportunity for a spoof program to take over the 
operating system and should only be done with care if the program 
absolutely needs elevated privileges to do its work. None of the WSJT 
group of programs, to my knowledge, require elevated privileges.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Also,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> since removing is a simple matter of deleting the wsjtx directory, 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> does it
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> follow that no other windows config changes such as registry 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> manipulation
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> are performed during the install?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Yes.
</I>This is not quite true, the installer for WSJT-X does write to the 
registry to record the uninstall details. Although no harm will come by 
deleting the install directory, it is best to check if there is an 
uninstall entry available via the &quot;Control Panel&quot; and use that to remove 
software to achieve the cleanest uninstall behaviour.
