<PRE>Don --

WSJT-X computes the sequence of Tx tone frequencies and stores them in a 
global array itone[].  There are 126 elements in the array for JT65, 
with values in the range 0-65.  For JT9 there are 85 values in the range 
0-8.

Of course you're welcome to make whatever use of these you may want.  To 
make a &quot;transmission&quot; from these values, your software would need to do 
the necessary symbol timing, etc.  To make a clean signal you would need 
to assure phase continuity during frequency transitions.

Your first task, necessarily, would be be be able to build an executable 
for the unmodified WSJT-X.  We're not set up to be able to offer much 
help of that sort, so you're on your own there.
