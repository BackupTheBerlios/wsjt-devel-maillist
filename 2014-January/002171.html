<PRE>Joe &amp; friends


For many months I have had an intermittent (1 in 20 QSO) problem using wsjtx.
From time-to-time the signal transmitted is significantly distorted.I tried to attach a GIF and wav file of a bad TX but the moderator rejected the email over 40k. So -- If you would like a copy of the GIF and wav files please send me a direct email request.

I used VAC ver 4.13 Audio Repeater to record the wav file so I know that the distortion is not in the radio.
I worked with Eugene Muzychenko for a couple of weeks but we were not able to find any configuration that would eliminate the problem.
I am now working with Neal Campbell&#160; to do everything we can to ensure that the new i7 16G machine is correct.

I've come here to ask for any ideas as to the cause and fix to my problem.
Does anyone recognize the sound and wave forms in error?
Is this a common DSP error pattern?

Environment:

i7 3930K 16 GB&#160; ASUS P9X79LE motherboard
Windows 7 Home Premium
Display AMD Radeon 7800
Radio Apache-Labs 100D
OpenHPSDR mRX PS v3.2.7
WSJT-X v 1.3, r3673
JTAlert 2.4.13
DDUtil_V3
HRD 6.1.4

When this problem occurs I immediately HALT Tx and 
then Enable Tx again. Most times this corrects the problem, but some 
times it will occur for three cycles in a row.

Only as a guess, as I have not read the code, I wonder if this caused by a 
'hard slam' of signal at the start of the Tx between WSJT-X and VAC. 
Could WSJT-X be modified to Tx a idle silent tone ( 1K -140dbm ) always, even when CAT Tx is not active, thus keeping all of the buffers in the 
VAC chain full with something valid. I am assuming that zero is not a 
good PCM value.

As I am at &quot;wits end&quot;, all ideas will be appreciated.
