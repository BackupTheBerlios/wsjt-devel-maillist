<PRE>Hi Chuck,

Yes: either turn radio on, or disable CAT control.

&gt;<i> 2. The tutorial states that there are at least 8 JT-9 signals and all but
</I>&gt;<i> one are decodable.  I count 8 noticeable bumps in the scope trace. If
</I>&gt;<i> that's what were talking about I'd like to point that out explicitly, ok?
</I>
Now that you've drawn my attention to it, I can see that really there 
are only seven JT9 signals. (Three other vertical stripes on the 
waterfall, and small blips on the green line, are too narrow to be JT9 
signals.)

I've changed that sentence to read &quot;Seven JT9 signals are present in the 
example file, all decodable.&quot;  (not committed yet, I have other pending 
changes as well).  You could add something more if you want to describe 
what to look for, on the waterfall and spectral display.

&gt;<i> 3) After loading the file I saw 7 decodes in the band activity panel screen
</I>&gt;<i> but none in the Rx Frequency Panel.  I tried reloading the 130418_1742.wav
</I>&gt;<i> sample file several times ( with radio on).
</I>
Maybe you did not set Rx Frequency to 1224 Hz, as instructed??  Use the 
spinner control just above the Tx=Rx button.

&gt;<i> Also, the red and green markers
</I>&gt;<i> at the top of the wide graph do not move. I tried exiting the program and
</I>&gt;<i> starting the load/decode over and that did not fix it.
</I>
Clicking anywhere on the waterfall moves the green marker to that 
frequency.  Ctrl-click moves both green and red markers.

Double-click on a decoded text line moves the green and red markers to 
the frequency of that signal, UNLESS it's someone calling MyCall (and 
therefore highlighted in red).  In that case, only the green marker is 
moved.
