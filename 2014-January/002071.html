<PRE>&gt;<i> I'd like to propose making WSJT-X v1.2.2 r3644 a full release.  I have
</I>&gt;<i> packaged it for Windows and put it on the WSJT web page:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJTX_122r3644.exe">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJTX_122r3644.exe</A>
</I>
Is there a link to a build newer than 3644?  (I think I read a message about
such a build but I deleted the message.)  I continue to run 3590 but would
be glad to jump to a newer version.


&gt;<i> I am not fully confident that the occasional crashes reported by a few
</I>&gt;<i> users have been fixed -- but I have not been able to either replicate
</I>&gt;<i> them or isolate them in a useful way.  Still TBD, I guess.  Do let me
</I>&gt;<i> know if you have any insight about them.
</I>
I've been running 1.2.1 r3590 for some time ... and there were a couple of
days where I had a rash of them at the home station ... and one day where I
had about a half-hour similar problem with crashing at the NC1I station.
This would seem to rule out computers; the setups were pretty much the same:
using a microHAM device for audio and rig control and FTDX5000.

My gut feeling is the crashes were attributed to something being decoded
being sent by a specific station as it was fairly consistent for a period of
time that I was operating (normally evenings UTC-0500 on 7.076 MHz) - QSY or
going QRT and coming back later never had the problem.  And FWIW - I have
not seen a crash now in some time.  (Offending station not being heard?!)
