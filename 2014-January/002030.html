<PRE>Hi all,

I'd like to propose making WSJT-X v1.2.2 r3644 a full release.  I have 
packaged it for Windows and put it on the WSJT web page:

<A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJTX_122r3644.exe">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJTX_122r3644.exe</A>

At present there is no visible link to this package.

If you normally run Windows, please install this package (or compile it 
yourself) and give it a workout.  If you normally use *nix or OSX, 
please compile it and give it a workout.

If all seems well, I'd like to make this version our &quot;full release&quot; in a 
week or so.

Changes from our beta release r3590 are minor.  The only visible one is 
a new spectrum-flattening procedure: instead of setting a &quot;Slope&quot; 
parameter, check the &quot;Flatten&quot; box on the Wide Graph window.

I am not fully confident that the occasional crashes reported by a few 
users have been fixed -- but I have not been able to either replicate 
them or isolate them in a useful way.  Still TBD, I guess.  Do let me 
know if you have any insight about them.

FYI: Two developments are presently under way that could lead to new 
beta releases:

1. Bill (G4WJS) is working on some all-new rig control code, as well as 
other changes.  He is waiting to commit these until after we make this 
release.

2. In SVN .../branches/wsjtx_w, I have been working on code that will 
implement a version of JT9 with wide tone spacings, intended for 
microwave EME.

As always, your comments are welcome.  Especially, please let me know if 
your see any problem with making an open release of WSJT-X v1.2.2 r3644.

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
