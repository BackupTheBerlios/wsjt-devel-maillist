</I>&gt;<i> Hi John,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> A correspondent wrote to me today concerning the ADI log as follows:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &quot;One small enhancement that would be nice is if WSJT-X were to plug 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> in the OPERATOR field into the ADIF record, using the call of the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> station at hand. My MLDX log (and perhaps that of many other folks) 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> is populated with all of my QSO's since becoming a ham back in 1964. 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Over those 50 years, I've had several calls due to moves around the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> country. Each record I populated into MLDX was set with my call at 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> the time of that QSO. So, it is very easy for me to see what QSO's I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> had made with various calls. As it is now, WSJT-X does not fill in 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> that field, and it must be manually entered into the log after ADIF 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> import.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> There might need to be a configuration field to set the station 
</I>&gt;<i> callsign since the callsign domain of JT65/JT9 is smaller than the 
</I>&gt;<i> amateur callsign domain.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> This is really a logging program deficiency since STATION_CALLSIGN 
</I>&gt;<i> (and OPERATOR) are core ADIF fields and the logging program should 
</I>&gt;<i> provide a default for at least one of them where an incoming log 
</I>&gt;<i> record doesn't have a values for either.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Since STATION_CALLSIGN is supposed to be the callsign given on air for 
</I>&gt;<i> a QSO, then I think that is the field we should provide if any.
</I>
Looking at the MLDX docs I see that it probably doesn't support the ADIF 
field STATION_CALLSIGN either so that might complicate matters further :(

&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> As regards this report:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Briefly, r3590 would crash often, when changing frequency or band,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> either by selecting a new freq/band or replying to a call on a 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> different
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> frequency.
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Using v1.2.1 r3590 and noticed similar behaviour: the program 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> crashed a few
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> times when I changed bands and once when I turned the radio off.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> I have received no problems from around 20 to 30 Mac users of r3590 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> about crashes when changing frequency as described above.   The code 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> seems to be stable.
