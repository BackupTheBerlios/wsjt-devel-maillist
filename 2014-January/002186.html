<PRE>Greetings All,



Early this morning I am sure I read within the new User's Guide a very 
detailed, and thorough instruction set to compile a Linux build of WSJT-X.



It seems it was edited out sometime today. I guess for clarity, and a 
limited audience. I cannot find them now. I believe they were in Section 3, 
or subsection 3.4.



Would it be possible for the author to post those instruction here? Or, the 
Linux Ham Yahoo Group?



I would really like to try to compile a Linux version the current release 
of WSJT-X, but I need help, and those instructions are the best I have ever 
seen. Particularly, as I recall, the details that relate to the KV decoder. 
Symbolic links, and things like that, were well documented. The procedures 
made sense to me, and I feel I have a good chance of success following 
those instructions.



If it's not to much trouble. I think it would be of great interest to a lot 
of other &quot;Linux&quot; hams too.



Thanks.

</PRE>
