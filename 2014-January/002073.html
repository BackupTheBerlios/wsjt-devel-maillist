<PRE>Hi Bob,

Good to hear from you!

&gt;<i> Is there a link to a build newer than 3644?  (I think I read a message about
</I>&gt;<i> such a build but I deleted the message.)  I continue to run 3590 but would
</I>&gt;<i> be glad to jump to a newer version.
</I>
Not sure what you're after, here.  Of course, 3644 is newer that 3590.
In an earlier message to wsjt-devel I included a link to a package for 
r3644:
<A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJTX_122r3644.exe">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJTX_122r3644.exe</A>

If you want something later than that, e.g. from the HEAD of the SVN 
repository, you need to compile it yourself.

&gt;<i> My gut feeling is the crashes were attributed to something being decoded
</I>&gt;<i> being sent by a specific station as it was fairly consistent for a period of
</I>&gt;<i> time that I was operating (normally evenings UTC-0500 on 7.076 MHz) - QSY or
</I>&gt;<i> going QRT and coming back later never had the problem.  And FWIW - I have
</I>&gt;<i> not seen a crash now in some time.  (Offending station not being heard?!)
</I>
I think it unlikely that a decoded message could trigger a program 
crash.  But if it did -- and certainly I have been surprised before! -- 
the corresponding recorded *.wav file should cause the same misbehavior. 
  I would welcome receipt of such a *.wav file.

	-- Joe, K1JT
