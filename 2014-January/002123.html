</I>&gt;&gt;<i> there is no &quot;TX message pre-loading&quot; capability as you describe it.
</I>&gt;<i> Oops - my bad.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> And correct me if I'm wrong - but I think in the WSJT 9 program when you

</I>&gt;<i> WSJT-X and the HF world coming from EME.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've probably done this on quite a few QSO's - if it is changing the bits

</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I wonder then ... how does the decoder handle / tolerate this?  (What did
</I>&gt;<i> the receiving stations see when I did this?)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If it is OK to do in the first few seconds of the transmission (switch to a
</I>&gt;<i> different message) and the other side gets it right - that's cool ...
</I>&gt;<i> otherwise I think that being able to change messages in the middle of a
</I>&gt;<i> stream &lt;sic&gt; isn't necessarily a good feature.  (I guess I'd rather have the
</I>&gt;<i> buttons either inop or buffered until after the transmission completes.)
</I>I'm not certain on the exact logic or decoder behaviour but I believe 
that it is quite possible to change the outgoing message up to around 
half way through the TX period (~+25s) and have the QSO partner decode 
the latter message successfully.

I suspect that free text messages are least likely to be decoded when 
started late as they have the lowest level of forward error correction, 
but nevertheless solid reception for a complete period is not required 
for a decode.

It also appears that the message being received at the end of the period 
is most likely to be decoded.

So as you can see it is quite reasonable for the program to allow you to 
change your mind at least part way into the TX period.
