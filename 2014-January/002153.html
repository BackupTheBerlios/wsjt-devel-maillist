<PRE>Hi Chase,

I'm sorry, we may have been working somewhat at cross purposes.

I had assumed that you were following the traffic on wsjt-devel about 
WSJT-X documentation -- especially starting with two messages from me on 
Jan 21 with Subject headings &quot;scope and purview&quot; and &quot;WSJT-X 
Documentation&quot;, and follow-ups.

Essentially, we have scrapped the MS-Word file and gone over to using 
the markup language &quot;AsciiDoc&quot;.  The resulting source files are now in 
the SVN repository, in subdirectory .../branches/wsjtx/doc.  The current 
version of the User's Guide built from those source files is posted at

<A HREF="http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx-doc/wsjtx-main-toc2.html">http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx-doc/wsjtx-main-toc2.html</A>

and can be displayed by your browser from the WSJT-X 1.2.2 r3669 Help 
menu.  I have done a lot of editing, as well as some re-arranging and 
some additions, to get to the present status.  Others are working on 
some of the still-missing sections.
