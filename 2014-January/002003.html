Hi John,
&gt;<i> A correspondent wrote to me today concerning the ADI log as follows:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;One small enhancement that would be nice is if WSJT-X were to plug in the OPERATOR field into the ADIF record, using the call of the station at hand. My MLDX log (and perhaps that of many other folks) is populated with all of my QSO's since becoming a ham back in 1964. Over those 50 years, I've had several calls due to moves around the country. Each record I populated into MLDX was set with my call at the time of that QSO. So, it is very easy for me to see what QSO's I had made with various calls. As it is now, WSJT-X does not fill in that field, and it must be manually entered into the log after ADIF import.&quot;
</I>
There might need to be a configuration field to set the station callsign 
since the callsign domain of JT65/JT9 is smaller than the amateur 
callsign domain.

This is really a logging program deficiency since STATION_CALLSIGN (and 
OPERATOR) are core ADIF fields and the logging program should provide a 
default for at least one of them where an incoming log record doesn't 
have a values for either.

Since STATION_CALLSIGN is supposed to be the callsign given on air for a 
QSO, then I think that is the field we should provide if any.
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> As regards this report:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> Briefly, r3590 would crash often, when changing frequency or band,
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> either by selecting a new freq/band or replying to a call on a different
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> frequency.
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Using v1.2.1 r3590 and noticed similar behaviour: the program crashed a few
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> times when I changed bands and once when I turned the radio off.
</I>&gt;<i> I have received no problems from around 20 to 30 Mac users of r3590 about crashes when changing frequency as described above.   The code seems to be stable.
