<PRE>My name is Clark and my call sign is AL7EK.  I am a retired professional electrical engineer and software developer.  While employed I did a lot of .net development (industrial control, SCADA, data communications) but now that no one is paying me, I don't have much interest in Microsoft.  At home I have a bunch of OSX and IOS devices.  I've also dabbled with Linux quite a number of times at home.  

I'm familiar with C# and VB.net.  I'm learning Python, QT, and Objective C but I'm not competent with these yet.  I know a little C and C++.  I knew fortran about 40 years ago when I studied it in engineering school.  

If you'll have me, I'd like to help you guys develop WSJT-X.  I can certainly perform simple code changes, limited to my experience with C and Fortran.  While less exciting, I can also do testing and documentation.  

I've tried to setup Netbeans on my iMac with OSX 10.8.5 to compile WSJT-X but I'm having lots of problems doing that.  I've set that aside since I think you might be using QTCreator.  

Right now I am trying to set up QTCreator 3.0.0 and QT 5.2.0 to build and run wsjtx.  I've had no luck so far.  I am having to make quite a number of changes to the source that doesn't seem reasonable&#8230;..lots of changes in header files.  I also am missing some libraries.  

Before I bother you with my problems, I'm wondering if I'm even using the right tools.  Will I be able to build and run with QTCreator 3.0.0 and QT 5.2.0 or should I have installed other versions?  Please let me know what development tools are being used to develop wsjtx.

I'd love to help on this project!

Clark
