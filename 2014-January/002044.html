<PRE>Hi Joe

I have some documentation below for 'Show DXCC and Worked B4 Status'.  I 
think I sent this to the list once before but may have got lost.  I'm on 
Linux and I'm not confident that my Libre Office docx files will retain 
all the formatting. I just did a quick test saving the existing 1.2 doc 
and it came out 10% smaller.  Hmm, that doesn't inspire confidence!  
Could you or some other kind person please paste it into a suitable 
place in the manual?

I've done a fresh check out of R3651 on Linux (Mint 14) and it compiles 
and runs fine.  The flatten feature works very well.

I'm in discussions with Clark AL7EK about some changes to worked B4 and 
the log file it uses but we'll hold off on any code changes until after 
this release.

Cheers
Murray VK3ACF

============================

Show DXCC entity and worked B4 status

This adds the name of the DXCC entity and whether you've worked this 
entity and/or call before to any CQ calls displayed in the Band Activity 
window. It considers JT9 and JT65 to be the same mode but does 
differentiate between bands.

While it will work on the Windows version of WSJT-X it is mainly 
intended Linux and Mac users. Windows users can (and should) use 
VK3AMA's excellent JT-Alert utility available from <A HREF="http://ham-apps.com">http://ham-apps.com</A>

Your worked before status is displayed as a single character with a 
change of background colour:

! (bright green) New DXCC entity
~ (mid green) You've already worked this DXCC entity but not this station.
(dull green) You've previously worked the calling station.

Following the above is the DXCC entity name abbreviated if required to 
fit the available space.

Requirements

WSJTX expects the file cty.dat installed in wsjtx_install. This contains 
the DXCC data, is regularly updated and can be downloaded from 
<A HREF="http://www.country-files.com/cty/">http://www.country-files.com/cty/</A>

Your previous history is read from wsjtx_log.adi (found in 
wsjtx_install). This file is updated every time you log a QSO from 
WSJT-X (but note that it can also be erased from the file menu). You can 
append or overwrite this file by exporting your QSO history as an ADIF 
file from another logging program. Turning 'Show DXCC entity and worked 
B4 status' off and on again will cause WSJT-X to re-read this log file. 
Note that very large ADIF log files may cause WSJT-X to slow down while 
searching for calls.
