<PRE>Here's a brief update on the WSJT-X User's Guide.

The SVN repository presently has the sources for a version that, when 
processed by asciidoc, yield an html file that in most respects is 
accurate, looks good, and reads well.

Here's a list (not necessarily complete) of things that I know still 
need to be done:

1. Section 6.2 (on the use of Compound Callsigns) is incomplete and in 
some respects inaccurate.  I will rework it.

2. The lists of installed and runtime files, sections 10.1 and 10.2, 
need updating.

3. All links need to be tested.

4. All steps in the Tutorial need testing (preferable by someone other 
than me).

5. Text written by Murray on &quot;DXCC and Worked B4&quot; needs to be integrated 
somewhere.

And finally, several new sections should probably be written:

1. Cooperative Programs: basic description of the way WSJT-X works
together with JT-Alertm, Commander, and HRD.

2. Frequenctly Asked Questions

3. Troubleshooting

I'm very open to critiques of the User's Guide as it now stands, and to 
all suggestions on things that would improve it.

My next efforts will be on sections 6.2 (Compound Callsigns) and 10 
(Appendix A).  If you would like to work on another one of the above 
items, or something else that you think desirable, please make your 
intentions known!
