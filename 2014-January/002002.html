<PRE>A correspondent wrote to me today concerning the ADI log as follows:

&quot;One small enhancement that would be nice is if WSJT-X were to plug in the OPERATOR field into the ADIF record, using the call of the station at hand. My MLDX log (and perhaps that of many other folks) is populated with all of my QSO's since becoming a ham back in 1964. Over those 50 years, I've had several calls due to moves around the country. Each record I populated into MLDX was set with my call at the time of that QSO. So, it is very easy for me to see what QSO's I had made with various calls. As it is now, WSJT-X does not fill in that field, and it must be manually entered into the log after ADIF import. &quot;

As regards this report:

&gt;&gt;<i> Briefly, r3590 would crash often, when changing frequency or band,
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> either by selecting a new freq/band or replying to a call on a different
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> frequency.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Using v1.2.1 r3590 and noticed similar behaviour: the program crashed a few
</I>&gt;<i> times when I changed bands and once when I turned the radio off.
</I>
I have received no problems from around 20 to 30 Mac users of r3590 about crashes when changing frequency as described above.   The code seems to be stable.
