I'm using Windows v1.2.1 r3590 - really like this feature.  I've been
looking for some documentation on this and must have missed the previous
posting. 

IMO this would be great to get into the documentation!


&gt;<i> Your worked before status is displayed as a single character with a change
</I>of
&gt;<i> background colour:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> ! (bright green) New DXCC entity
</I>&gt;<i> ~ (mid green) You've already worked this DXCC entity but not this station.
</I>&gt;<i> (dull green) You've previously worked the calling station.
</I>
Is it possible to change the background colours?  On my system (decent
monitors / high resolution) I have a hard time telling the difference
between the mid green and the dull green.  (And I had no idea what the
characters were preceding the DXCC country name until I read this post!)


&gt;<i> Requirements
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Your previous history is read from wsjtx_log.adi (found in wsjtx_install).
</I>\
&gt;<i> This file is updated every time you log a QSO from WSJT-X (but note that
</I>it 
&gt;<i> can also be erased from the file menu). 
</I>
In my workflow I have been importing the ADI file into DXkeeper (log
program) and then using the erase function ... figuring that the wsjtx.log
file (which doesn't seem to get erased) was being used for the worked B4
functionality.

I think it's a lot easier to just import a whole file of the most recent
batch of &quot;worked&quot; stations ... rather than letting the ADIF file build up
and then having to come up with a way to determine what should be imported
(into your logging program).  Maybe there's a way to accommodate this in a
future version?
