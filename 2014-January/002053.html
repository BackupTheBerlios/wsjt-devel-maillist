<PRE>Hi all,

Let me introduce two new team members, Chuck (KB1ZMX) and Chase (W4TI). 
  They have volunteered to help with the documentation for WSJT-X -- an 
important but all-too-easily neglected part of our development effort. 
Greg, KI7MT, has also put significant effort into the documentation, 
back in September.  I have been remiss in not following up on his work. 
  This email is an attempt to start some coordination among these efforts.

For a brief introduction on what Greg has done, point your web browser to
<A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx-doc/wsjtx-main.html">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx-doc/wsjtx-main.html</A>

As stated at its top, this version of the WSJT-X User Guide is based on 
the Version 1.2 guide that I produced, dated August 16, 2013.  Greg has 
reformatted it using the markup language &quot;AsciiDoc&quot;; he has added a 
bunch of HTML anchors and hyperlinks, and an &quot;Appendix D&quot; as an 
illustration of rig-specific configuration.

The source file for Greg's version of the manual can be seen at
<A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx-doc/source/wsjtx-main.txt">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjtx-doc/source/wsjtx-main.txt</A>

Greg's description of what he did was sent to a few of us back in 
September.  I will append it below, for all to see.

I suggest that everyone should take a look at what Greg has done, and 
then weigh in on whether you think this is a good way to go for WSJT-X 
documentation.  You might also want to look at
<A HREF="http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/">http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/</A> for an idea of how AsciiDoc works.
I find it an attractive prospect -- one that should blend in well with 
our multi-platform approach and our SVN repository.

Your comments will be appreciated.

Here's Greg's email of Sept 23, 2013:

All,

While all the Developers on the WSJT Dev team are highly skilled code 
writers, allot of us in the user community may not be so savey with 
C/C++/G95 etc but would like to contribute meaningful data to the 
project. Maybe this is a way to do that.

I had some time over the last few days while working on the Ubuntu 
Manual stuff and thought I'd put together something that may be useful 
for the WSJT application(s), in the case WSJT-X.


Attached is a file (tar.gz or.tgz) containing 5 html files, the 
associated .txt source files, Images + Icons used, and the example build 
script to generate them.

I used Asciidoc as the markup language (and the default templates), as 
it is Very Simple, Fast and uses Text Source files. For those not 
familiar with it, it can produce, XMl, HTML, XHTML, DocBook, LaTex, PDF, 
e-pub, Slidy roff (man Pages) PS etc etc all with a simple one-line 
command. The 5 finished files are W3C CSS-3.0 and XHTML 1.1 compliant. 
Go to W3C validator, upload the file + check for full results.

I used a single main file (wsjtx-doc.txt), but this could easily be 
broken out into chapters/sections, allowing for easy community 
contribution, which I think would be a good idea.

The 5 files are non-data-uri, meaning, I did now embed the images, but 
could easily be done with one switch --data-uri will make a stand alone 
HTML file. It still needs allot of attention, but the base is there.

In the archive, there are 3 versions of the main file, which use the 
same source, wsjtx-doc.txt (all are CSS-3 and xhtml 1.1):


wsjtx-main.html: Single File Doc, No Table of Contents (TOC)
wsjtx-doc-toc.html: Single File, TOC at the Top, 2 Levels Down.
wsjtx-doc-toc2.html: Single File, TOC2 = Left Frame TOC, 2 Levels down.

Build Switch --toc-levels=X sets the resolution, default is (2), max is (4)

e.g 1.0, 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.1.1.1

The --toc switch in the build command determines if TOC's are used or 
not, and if so which type. YOu can also turn them off/on in file headers 
with :toc:

In Order: No TOC, TOC @ Top, TOC in Left Frame

asciidoc -a -o wsjtx-main-toc.html ${src_dir}/wsjtx-main.txt

asciidoc -a toc -o wsjtx-main-toc.html ${src_dir}/wsjtx-main.txt

asciidoc -a toc2 -o wsjtx-main-toc2.html ${src_dir}/wsjtx-main.txt


The other two file are also single files, from a single source, but 
neither have a TOC. They are just an example / idea on how we could 
socialite and get participation from the user community to work on 
documentation.


I'm not sure whether including the source &amp; build structure within the 
wsjtx svn branch is best, or maybe creating a WSJT documentation project 
would be better, that way it could expand to WPSR, WSPRX MAP65, SimJT 
and appeal to a much larger audience.

In any case, let me know what ya think, worth the effort Y/N?, Scrap The 
Idea, needs different approach, something else?
