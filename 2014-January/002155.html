<PRE>Hi to everyone!

I've worked through the manual up to the tutorial pages and found nothing
amiss. Even made a few contacts.  My MO BTW is to follow the directions and
see if all works out as advertised. So far so good except for a few things
that are probably rig-specific regarding split mode.  More on that anon.

I have a few questions on the tutorial pages.

1) With the radio turned off the controls are delayed and a bit erratic,
which I presume is normal behavior for the program.  Would you agree that
we should make a recommendation to keep the radio on, say into a dummy
load, while running thru the tutorial.?  Also I want to direct them to
change the callsign to K1JT upfront so the on-screen color bars match the
tutrorial.

2. The tutorial states that there are at least 8 JT-9 signals and all but
one are decodable.  I count 8 noticeable bumps in the scope trace. If
that's what were talking about I'd like to point that out explicitly, ok?

3) After loading the file I saw 7 decodes in the band activity panel screen
but none in the Rx Frequency Panel.  I tried reloading the 130418_1742.wav
sample file several times ( with radio on). Also, the red and green markers
at the top of the wide graph do not move. I tried exiting the program and
starting the load/decode over and that did not fix it.

I'll wait for answers before proceeding.  73, chuck
.
