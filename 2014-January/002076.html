<PRE>Hi Bob

The colours for the worked before status are currently hard coded in the 
source.  But now that you know what the symbols mean that shouldn't 
matter so much.

Your work flow with the ADI log file would not seem to be uncommon.  I'm 
currently thinking along the lines of giving the user a file selector in 
the configuration window to choose where the worked B4 status is stored 
and read from. That should help alleviate most of these problems.  Note 
that most logging programs (DX Keeper included I pretty sure) can easily 
deal with duplicate entries.  I just import the entire log and then 
click delete duplicates (I'm using CQR Log).

And.. if I'm setting up an extra tab on the configuration window I have 
an opportunity to add colour pickers for the marked text, and the symbol 
choices too I guess. But that won't be for this release.  Even the 
documentation might get done!

Cheers
Murray
