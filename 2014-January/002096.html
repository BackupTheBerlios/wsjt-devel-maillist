<PRE>Hi Joe, All,

See comments below.

&gt;<i> Hi Greg (and all),
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for your continued work on the User's Guide.  As it happens, I
</I>&gt;<i> did more-or-less the same thing, yesterday, splitting wsjtx-main.txt
</I>&gt;<i> into a number of smaller files.  I then did some extensive editing on them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Today I merged my edits into (more or less) your file structure, and
</I>&gt;<i> committed everything to the SVN repository.  As noted in the commit Log
</I>&gt;<i> message, Sections 6.2, 8, and beyond definitely need work.  Other
</I>&gt;<i> polishing is also desirable, and no doubt there will be further
</I>&gt;<i> additions and/or changes.
</I>
** I pulled the latest svn this evening, looks pretty good. I'll wait
until you've finished your edits before messing about any further.

&gt;<i> [Note: It's possible that we've gone somewhat too far in splitting the
</I>&gt;<i> files into small pieces.  Some of the new files are only a few hundred
</I>&gt;<i> characters long.]
</I>
** Yes, that is a potential problem using this method. Maybe a standard
practice, at the Section level, leave the first paragraph in
wsjtx-main.txt or something?

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> By tomorrow I hope to finish what I know needs to be done to Section 6.2
</I>&gt;<i> and from Section 8 to the end.  Then I'll let it stand for a bit.
</I>&gt;<i> At that point, others can look it over and decide what they think still
</I>&gt;<i> needs work, what parts they'd like to work on, etc.
</I>
** Section 9: The JT9 Protocol, decoding discrete blocks
- I found a few Asciidoc plug-in's that may be useful in building a
diagram for this. It would require a couple small python modules, but
they are in the repo's. The following links illustrate the possibilities:

Main Plug-in Page: <A HREF="http://asciidoc.org/plugins.html">http://asciidoc.org/plugins.html</A>
Diag Specific Page: <A HREF="https://code.google.com/p/asciidoc-diag-filter/">https://code.google.com/p/asciidoc-diag-filter/</A>

- I can have a crack at this, but I'm not sure I fully understand all
the elements in play, so it may need a bit of editing after.

&gt;<i> If you want to see what it looks like now, do something like this:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> $ cd wsjtx
</I>&gt;<i> $ svn up
</I>&gt;<i> $ cd doc
</I>&gt;<i> $ build-dos-sh toc2
</I>
** To Build: ./build-doc.sh toc2
- We can drop the .sh extension(s) if it is easier to use that way.

General Comments:

** build-check.sh
- I have the basic script finished. As it stands now it only pulls the
&quot;review&quot; flag, as the files have not been updated yet.

- If we want to utilize this capability, it may be worth writing up what
which tags will be used initially, then I can add to the check
capabilities for them.

- The tag line can contain more that just status=review, etc etc. It
could have release version info, editor, or whatever information is
deemed appropriate. Then we simply parse the line for whatever is needed.

** Stylesheet, Config, and .js
- It's too much for this post, but I'll send a separate e-mail on
recommendations for setting up a standalone build system, which will
allow customizing the stylesheet.

&gt;<i> ... and then point your browser at the newly generated file
</I>&gt;<i> wsjtx-main-toc2.html
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i>     -- Joe, K1JT
