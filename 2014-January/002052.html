<PRE>Hi Clark,

We'll be happy to have you on the WSJT development team.  As you have 
probably noticed, we're pretty loosely organized.  People work on what 
interests them most, and what they are good at.  We use this list for 
most communications.  When you're ready to be added to the group with 
SVN &quot;commit&quot; permission, let me know your Berlios login name.

As for your question on build environment: on Windows, we're using the 
MinGW version of Qt 5.2.  You need g++ and gcc, and either g95 or 
gfortran for the Fortran code.  Bill, G4WJS, uses CMake and make; I use 
QtCreator, qmake, and make.  I actually still use QtCreator 2.7.2, which 
came with Qt5.1, rather than v3.0 -- although 3.0 works fine for 
everything I've tried *except* printing program listings.  That has a 
bug that we are told will be fixed when Qt 5.2.1 is released.  With the 
proper tools installed, and your working environment set correctly, no 
code changes should be required for a good compile.

While employed I did a lot of .net development (industrial control, SCADA, data communications) but now that no one is paying me, I don't have much interest in Microsoft.  At home I have a bunch of OSX and IOS devices.  I've also dabbled with Linux quite a number of times at home.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'm familiar with C# and VB.net.  I'm learning Python, QT, and Objective C but I'm not competent with these yet.  I know a little C and C++.  I knew fortran about 40 years ago when I studied it in engineering school.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> If you'll have me, I'd like to help you guys develop WSJT-X.  I can certainly perform simple code changes, limited to my experience with C and Fortran.  While less exciting, I can also do testing and documentation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I've tried to setup Netbeans on my iMac with OSX 10.8.5 to compile WSJT-X but I'm having lots of problems doing that.  I've set that aside since I think you might be using QTCreator.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Right now I am trying to set up QTCreator 3.0.0 and QT 5.2.0 to build and run wsjtx.  I've had no luck so far.  I am having to make quite a number of changes to the source that doesn't seem reasonable&#8230;..lots of changes in header files.  I also am missing some libraries.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Before I bother you with my problems, I'm wondering if I'm even using the right tools.  Will I be able to build and run with QTCreator 3.0.0 and QT 5.2.0 or should I have installed other versions?  Please let me know what development tools are being used to develop wsjtx.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I'd love to help on this project!
