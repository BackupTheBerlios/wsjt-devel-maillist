<PRE>Hi Joe,

r3644 compiled and running.    Decoding is fine.

Problem with Flatten option which is selected on startup.    On my Mac OSX 10.9 the spectrum on the Wide Graph panel is a straight green line with no peaks.   The waterfall display is blank.    With Flatten deselected, the green spectrum appears.  Although the waterfall display is now active the waterfall background is now a green 'smear' from left to right indicative of too much gain.    Gain on the lower panel is set to 30dB.

Using Qt5.1.1

Diagnosis:   if I turn on the write statements in flat3 I find:

fort.21:            write(21,1010) f,y0(i),yfit(i),y0(i)-yfit(i)       :: f is just i*df;  but y0(i), yfit(i) are zero always:

worse, when I change the format from f to e, the output shows that y0 and yfit are mal-formed variables - the output is garbage

The problem is this statement:      implicit real*8 (a-h,o-z)   coupled with this:         y0(i)=db(s0(i))

The function db is deemed to be double precision by virtue of  the implicit statement but db is actually a single precision function.    Consequently y0(i) is filled with garbage since db only returns a 32-bit number.

The implicit statement is needed for the definitions of the arguments to polfit so  real*4 db is needed.

While trying to get to the bottom of this I was puzzled by  symspec:

     call flat3(s,iz,nfa,nfb,3,1.0,s)
     call flat3(savg,iz,nfa,nfb,3,1.0,savg)

where an argument is repeated.    The second argument is only used once at the end of flat3 as:

        s(i)=10.0**(0.1*y4)

Is there a reason why the duplication is needed?    Drop the final argument in symspec calls and flat3 definition, no need for real*4 s(iz),  and write:

      s0(i)=10.0**(0.1*y4) at the end of flat3.

Finally:   the waterfall display remains a greenish background from left to right when flatten is selected.    Much better without flatten - am I missing a tuning item?
