<PRE>Hi
After spending a day + downloading kernels and just running aplay -l and
pa_devs with my M-audio D66 card, I've come to the following
conclusions.
There is interaction between pulseadio and  alsa, but its more on the
default config scripts.
The major problem is the kernel, it could be something with Udev, but
from kernel 2.6.38 which is when Gnome 3 was shipped with some distros
the D66 card sampling rates are only read as 48000, thats when the card
is found.
Incidentally 2.6.38 is the changing point from kernel 2.6.x to 3.0.x
the last RT kernel 2.6.33 is OK so is 2.6.32-5 as shipped with Debian
squeeze.
Where I've been building equipment and not operating , as I upgraded
distros, I compiled wsjt but didn't check it used the correct sound
card, which with hind sight I should have.
I wasn't aware that wsjt uses a low sample rate 11025, which was why the
card was working with other apps, that use 48000.
I'll leave Fed FC15 with gnome 3 on the laptop, the xyl likes its
simplicity, and moved this machine to Deb squeeze.
Hope that save someone else's hair.
