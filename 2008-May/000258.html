I've been planning on doing this for a while. I'm busy at a conference
this week, so it won't be until next week. BTW, I nearly have
a wsjt PBI for PC-BSD ready to go as well.

The ham radio pbis are in <A HREF="http://www.pbidir.com/bt/category/utilities">http://www.pbidir.com/bt/category/utilities</A>

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Thanks for catching the pthread memory leak on Linux.
</I>
This will also have affected BSD.

&gt;<i> Should this have been a problem in Win32/MinGW, which also
</I>&gt;<i> uses pthreads and start_threads.c.  I haven't noticed that
</I>&gt;<i> it's a problem in that environment.  Should it also be a
</I>&gt;<i> problem in WJST?  I haven't noticed any problems there, either.
</I>
It probably should be backported.

&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> People may be interested to know that I ran some tests of
</I>&gt;<i> WSPR several nights ago on 2m EME.  VK7MO sent me WSPR
</I>&gt;<i> transmissions for about 50 minutes, running 150 Watts.  We
</I>&gt;<i> both have 4-yagi arrays on 2 meters.  I copied nearly every
</I>&gt;<i> transmission from him.  The reported SNR values ranged from
</I>&gt;<i> -24 to -27 dB.  It seems that WSPR should be a very
</I>&gt;<i> effective mode for 2m EME.
</I>
I have a sat capable station here, after seeing someone else with
a TS-2000 station and 100w manage to get some contacts using
WSJT, I intend on at least listening. The longer term goal is
to get some gain up on 1.2 and a brick/preamp on the tower.
