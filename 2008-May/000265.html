I know roughly what the problem with gfortran is, but we can tackle that
later. It's to do with at least mept162.f
gfortran does not like the continuation characters in column 6
and the 'C' in the first line. (Reminds me of my punched card days...)
This should be easy to fix.

Well, portaudio v18 and portaudio v19 have both been available as
packages on FreeBSD, debian/ubuntu etc.  for quite a while.
The difficulty is two fold. A lot of packages that use portaudio are
still using v18. The ABI i.e. the format of structures and function
call parameters changed between v18 and v19; thus they are incompatible.
If you include v18 include files instead of v19 include files the wspr/wsjt
compile will break badly. Secondly, v19 has never been formally released,
though they are finally working on that.

Since every distribution is free to install v19 portaudio wherever it
wants to, it could be installed in /usr/include/portaudio which then
promptly breaks applications expecting to see v18 portaudio there.
FreeBSD sticks the v19 headers and libs in /usr/local/include/portaudio2
and /usr/local/lib/portaudio2; I do not know where other distributions
stick it unless I am told. It might be a horrible mess to hard code
paths depending on distribution and version. If our end users stick
to FreeBSD ports/packages, Debian .deb, redhat/fedora  or even PC-BSD PBIs
then there isn't a problem. Each distribution can set up wsjt/wspr
to work.

The other problem is known release compabilities. It is always possible
that a user could install the latest and greatest portaudio v19 straight
from the portaudio site and wsjt/wspr stop working or core, then they
bug us about it. This was the motivation for me including a snapshot
of portaudio with wsjt originally. I hate the additional baggage it adds,
but portaudio v19 is a moving target. When portaudio v19 is released,
we can tell users to make sure they have a v19 portaudio installed
and go from there.

As I know the portaudio folks have a release of v19 pending, I'm just
as happy to wait a little longer before importing a known working
portaudio v19 into the wspr tree.
