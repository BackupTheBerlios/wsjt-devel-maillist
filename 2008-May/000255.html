<PRE>Hi Bruce (and other WSJT/MAP65/WSPR developers),

For historical reasons (aka laziness ?), I still use Python 
2.3 in my Windows development machine.  I have therefore put 
a conditional import into f2py.py.

We definitely need to have autoconf/automake scripts for 
WSPR ... and also for MAP65.  I've never learned to do that 
properly; Diane, VA3DB, is responsible for the excellent 
ones in the WSJT trunk.  It should be possible to move these 
over to WSPR (and MAP65), I imagine, but I haven't put any 
effort into this.  I'm sure you can do it better than I can.

Thanks for catching the pthread memory leak on Linux. 
Should this have been a problem in Win32/MinGW, which also 
uses pthreads and start_threads.c.  I haven't noticed that 
it's a problem in that environment.  Should it also be a 
problem in WJST?  I haven't noticed any problems there, either.

People may be interested to know that I ran some tests of 
WSPR several nights ago on 2m EME.  VK7MO sent me WSPR 
transmissions for about 50 minutes, running 150 Watts.  We 
both have 4-yagi arrays on 2 meters.  I copied nearly every 
transmission from him.  The reported SNR values ranged from 
-24 to -27 dB.  It seems that WSPR should be a very 
effective mode for 2m EME.

Assuming that others on this list will be interested in the 
proposed &quot;WSPR QSO mode&quot;, after this message I will send one 
outlining my present plans and asking for your input.  I am 
sure the ideas can still be improved.

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
