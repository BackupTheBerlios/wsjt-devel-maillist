<PRE>Hi Diane,

Thanks for your message.  I know you have been planning to 
work on the autoconf/automake scripts, as well as the PBI 
package.  Those will be nice to have, when you can get to them.


&gt;&gt;<i>Thanks for catching the pthread memory leak on Linux.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> This will also have affected BSD.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>Should this have been a problem in Win32/MinGW, which also
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>uses pthreads and start_threads.c.  I haven't noticed that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>it's a problem in that environment.  Should it also be a
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>problem in WJST?  I haven't noticed any problems there, either.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It probably should be backported.
</I>
Almost certainly the reason it's a problem in WSPR, but has 
not been a problem in WSJT or MAP65, is that in WSJT and 
MAP65 the several threads are started just once.  They 
remain running thereafter, using idle loops when they have 
nothing to do.  In WSPR, on the other hand, threads are 
started as needed to do something (i.e., decode a block of 
received data), and they exit when done.
