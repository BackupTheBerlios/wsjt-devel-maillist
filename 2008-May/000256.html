<PRE>Dear WSJT/MAP65/WSPR Colleagues,

I write to bring you up to date on continuing evolution of 
the WSPR protocol and related software.

A &quot;QSO mode&quot; for this weak-signal protocol is in the works. 
  In fact, W6CQZ and I made the first WSPR-mode QSO on May 
6. We used simple antennas and power levels of 1 W at each 
end of the 4000 km path.  No big deal, on the 30 m band; but 
it nicely confirmed the capabilities of the mode for 2-way work.

The WSPR protocol is designed for use with extremely weak 
signals.  It's suitable for making basic amateur contacts 
over any propagation path that provides S/N exceeding -29 dB 
in reference bandwidth 2500 Hz, with Doppler spreading less 
than about 1 Hz.  Such paths should include most LF, MF, and 
HF paths of interest to amateurs, as well as the EME path at 
VHF.

WSPR messages are structured to permit efficient packing of 
callsigns, grid locators, signal reports, acknowledgments, 
and other information commonly exchanged in short QSOs. (The 
WSPR protocol is not attractive as a ragchewing mode, 
because its throughput is too slow.)  The protocol uses very 
strong forward error correction (FEC) using a 
long-constraint convolutional code (K=32, rate=1/2) and 
sequential decoding.  As in JT65, messages are almost always 
received exactly as transmitted, or else the decoder 
declares &quot;no result&quot; by remaining silent.  False decodes are 
extremely rare.

Several hundred present WSPR users are already familiar with 
its beacon-like messages formatted according to the template

   call grid dBm

In QSO mode WSPR messages have a much richer variety of 
formats, as illustrated by templates and examples in the 
following list:

Template                 Example of usage

PSE QSY freq KHZ         PSE QSY 1811 KHZ

Upper-case letters and numerals are conveyed exactly as 
shown in the templates.  Lower-case items are replaced by 
appropriate information, for example call=K1JT, grid=FN20, 
rpt=S1 to S9, name=JOE, wx=SNOW,  freetext=&quot;CUL JACK&quot;, etc., 
as shown in the examples.

Messages may contain one full callsign and one &quot;hash-coded&quot; 
callsign.  The transmission of hash codes is indicated by 
angle-brackets surrounding the call, as in &lt;K1JT&gt;; the 
brackets appear in displays of both transmitted and received 
messages.  Since hashing is a many-to-one mapping, the 
process is not reversible.  However, if a full callsign has 
been decoded in a previous transmission, the decoder may 
assume that a matching hash code usually implies matching 
callsigns.  With a 15-bit hash code the chances of 
mis-identification are very small, especially within the 
confines of a particular QSO.

A minimal QSO might look like this:

1. CQ K1JT FN20
2.                     &lt;K1JT&gt; W6CQZ
3. W6CQZ &lt;K1JT&gt; S4
4.                     K1JT &lt;W6CQZ&gt; R S3
5. &lt;W6CQZ&gt; K1JT RRR
6.                     TNX JOE 73 GL

A third-party operator listening to this QSO from the 
beginning would copy everything just as the participating 
stations do.  Even if only one of the QSO partners is 
copyable at the third station, both callsigns will be 
copied.  If the third-party operator tunes into the middle 
of a QSO, so that he cannot yet identify one of the hashed 
callsigns, his decoder will produce something like

    W6CQZ &lt;...&gt; S4

instead of the full message.  He must stay tuned to 
determine the identity of the missing callsign.  There will 
be no ambiguities at all for the participating stations: 
full callsigns are always decoded (or already available, in 
the case of one's own call) before their hash codes are needed.

Signal report S1 corresponds to &quot;-30 dB&quot; on the WSJT scale, 
S2=-27 dB, S3=-24 dB, etc., up to S9=-6 dB.  On this scale, 
the threshold for signal audibility is around S5 to S6.  The 
placeholder &quot;p/&quot; stands for an add-on prefix or suffix in 
compound callsigns like ZB2/DF2ZC or DH7FB/P.  Information 
conveying the prefix or suffix replaces the information that 
would otherwise convey a grid locator or hashed callsign.

Items &quot;pwr&quot;, &quot;gain&quot;, &quot;temp&quot;, and &quot;freq&quot; stand for numbers. A 
2m EME station might send

   1500 W 21 DBD

to inform his QSO partner about his equipment.  Similarly, a 
QRP HF station might send

   1 W 0 DBD

or

   5 W DIPOLE

If he finishes a QSO on 80 m and wants to try 160 m next, an 
operator might send

   PSE QSY 1811 KHZ

Weather reports can be conveyed by setting &quot;wx&quot; to SUNNY, 
CLOUDY, RAIN, or SNOW; &quot;temp&quot; can be sent in degrees C or F, 
with appropriate conversions made at the receiving end; 
&quot;wind&quot; can be set to CALM, BREEZES, or WINDY.

Names may contain up to 9 letters, and &quot;freetext&quot; may 
contain any combination of 8 or fewer letters, numerals, 
spaces, and the punctuation marks + . / ?.

Space has been reserved in the WSPR protocol for many more 
&quot;canned&quot; or &quot;partially canned&quot; messages like those in the 
final group of templates.  I hereby solicit suggestions for 
messages that might be included in this group.  Note that 
the variable information to be inserted in a given message 
type should be no more than one, two, or possibly three 
numbers or words.  Please help me to populate the list
of message types in the most useful way.

The first WSPR-mode QSO was made with a special version of 
the WSPR program, but future evolution will most likely 
follow a different path.  It seems best to keep the WSPR 
program relatively simple and intended for automatic, 
beacon-like transmission and reception of propagation test 
signals.  The next released version of WSPR will, however, 
be capable of decoding the QSO-mode messages.  For use in 
making QSOs, the WSPR protocol will be absorbed into a 
future version of WSJT.  This seems desirable because WSJT 
already has all of the necessary amenities for setting up 
messages, controlling the Tx/Rx sequences, etc.

How will WSPR compare in sensitivity with other weak signal 
communication modes?  Under the assumption of additive white 
gaussian noise, no QSB, and negligible Doppler spreading, 
the following table applies:

Mode   Threshold  Comments
          S/N
----------------------------------------------------
CW       -18 dB   Best human operators
JT65B    -24      KV decoder
JT65B    -27      Avg of 4 transmissions, KV decoder
JT65B    -28      Deep Search
WSPR     -29
WSPR     -32 ?    Avg of 4 synchronized transmissions

It should be noted that JT65 uses 1-minute T/R sequences 
while WSPR uses 2-minute sequences.  Averaging of multiple 
WSPR transmissions has not yet been tested.  The occupied 
bandwidth of a WSPR signal is about 6 Hz, 60 times smaller 
than the JT65B bandwidth.  Dozens of WSPR signals can be fit 
simultaneously in a 2 kHz SSB transceiver passband, with 
only a small probability of &quot;collisions&quot;.


More Technical Details

The WSPR message &quot;payload&quot; is 50 bits of information per 
transmission.  Most message formats use 28 bits for a 
standard callsign and 15 bits for a hash-coded callsign or 
grid locator.  The remaining 7 bits convey signal reports, 
acknowledgments, power levels, and special message types. 
Special messages may use the first 43 bits for any dedicated 
purpose.

The WSPR protocol uses continuous-phase 4-tone FSK with tone 
spacing and keying rate equal to 12000/8192 = 1.46 Hz.  Each 
transmission contains (50+K-1)*2 = 162 channel symbols, and 
each symbol conveys a data bit (MSB) and a synchronizing bit 
(LSB).  Transmissions last for 162*8192/12000 = 110.6 s. 
The occupied bandwidth of a WSPR signal is about 6 Hz.

Do let me know if you have suggestions!
