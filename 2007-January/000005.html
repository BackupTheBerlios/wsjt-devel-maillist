<PRE>Joe,

I appreciate such kind of wsjt package. There are plenty of small
distributions which people use for some reasons. Just to mention Vector,
DSL, Puppy etc. Installing deb or rpm packages on those might be a
difficult task for most of the users.

I found that libg2c.so.0 does not work here on my Mandriva 2007 with
2.6.17 kernel. Monitor file name is always: Mon_700101_000000 . If I
replace libg2c.so.0 with Mandriva's one all is fine.


&gt;<i> Probably it will also be good to change the default PTT port to 
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;/dev/ttyS0&quot;.   I thought this had already been done, but apparently not.
</I>
Yes this one will be nice. BTW Hamish already did that in his deb
packages.

&gt;<i> Would it also be best, in your opinion, to change the default audio 
</I>&gt;<i> device to &quot;1&quot; for both input and output?
</I>
I do not know. Perhaps Hamish gave the best explanation. In my case
Audio device 1 always works beter. No crash and beter decoding on all
wsjt revisions. But it was just the oposite on my Compaq Armada 7800
with ISA sound card /the same OS/. There the audio device 0 always works
and nothing else.

I am using the case to share experience with Windows WSJT. We tested on
several hardware and different Windows versions. We always had best
decode while NOT using MS sound mapper which is default device 0. All
tests were done in FSK441 mode and difference was amasing. Especially on
short, weak and phase shifted reflections.

73, Harry LZ1BB
