Good to hear from you!  If your computer is already properly configured 
for compiling WSJT, WSPR, MAP65, etc., then compiling WSJT in Windows 
(with MinGW) is done with just a &quot;make&quot; command.  You must have 
installed at least the following:

- subversion
- python2.5-dev
- python-numpy
- python-imaging-tk
- python-pmw
- libportaudio2
- libportaudio-dev
- libsamplerate0-dev
- g95

If you're not already set up in this way, it will surely be *much* 
easier to install a SPST switch in your DTR line than to copmpile a 
special version of the (obsolete) WSJT 5.9.7 or WSJT7.  :-)

I'm willing to back-port the code that you want and compile a special 
version of the old WSJT for you, but I have an important observation and 
request first.

Support for JT6M was not removed from WSJT lightly.  Strengths and 
weaknesses of the JT6M mode were thoroughly analyzed and compared with 
the new mode, ISCAT, over a period of several months.  Many, many 
comparison tests were made by a test group that included members from 
North America, Europe, and Australia.  Group members concluded 
unanimously that ISCAT is significantly superior to JT6M.  Nobody argued 
that JT6M's capabilities are competitive with ISCAT.

So, my request is this: can you (or anyone else) explain to me why JT6M 
is still widely used in EU, rather than ISCAT ??  Or why nobody made a 
convincing argument for why JT6M is &quot;better&quot;, when the comparisons were 
being made ??

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
