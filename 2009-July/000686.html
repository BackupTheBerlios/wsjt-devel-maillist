Hi
I suspect If got some hardware problems after the M-Audio D66 card was
getting a bit hot due to the voltage reg chip not being screwed down to
the card ground plane.
The most obvious symptom was jackd timing out and dropping transport
when running dttsp, thats now running again now the card running a lot
cooler.
BUT wsjt is running with no audio getting to it.  with no audio device
in use portaudio pa_devs reports all 10 devices dev0 being the alsa
D66.dev 0 selected in wsjt.
as soon as wsjt is started all the ALSA devices disappear when pa_devs
is run, I would expect the ALSA device for the D66 card no to be shown
leaving the remaining 9 devices, but it just leaves /dev/dsp &amp; /devdsp0.

this machine has had a complete reinstall and everything has been
rebuilt, as I first thought it was a nasty config problem.

Are there any test rxwav files that I could run though wsjt to check
that is working.
I'm 90% sure this is'nt a wsjt fault as other apps are not
quite right,wsjt is build 1271.
I'd appreciate any comments before I commit to replacing the card as
that series of card is like rocking horse dung to get hold of

TIA

Best wishes
