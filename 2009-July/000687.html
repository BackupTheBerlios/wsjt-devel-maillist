</I>&gt;<i> pthreads library, and a simple Fortran program that tests 
</I>&gt;<i> multi-threading with and without mutex lockouts.  I also

</I>&gt;<i>   
</I>After work yesterday I had a more detailed look. I am running ubuntu
karmic and I get the same segfault on start.
I use:
gdb python
run wsjt.py

It then tells me the line of the code that is crashing.
It is crashing inside a read statement.
When it crashes I can do a
thread apply all bt

This tells me what every thread was doing at the time of the crash. This
also tells me that it is not a re-entrant problem because no other
threads were calling read or write at the same time.
Simply adding a print * line above the crashing read statement stops it
crashing at that point.
When exiting the program, it crashes at another point that is a write
statement.
write(*,1006)
1006 format('Audio streams terminated normally.')

Using gdb I find that the parameter passed is not actually a pointer to
the &quot;Audio streams...&quot; string, but instead a pointer to an empty string!
I am starting to think that this is not a multi-thread problem at all.
I think it is a memory or stack corruption problem.
The problems where the crash happens are in:
a2d.f90:line 22
astro0.F90:line 22

Unfortunately, I have not found the actual cause yet.

Kind Regards

James
