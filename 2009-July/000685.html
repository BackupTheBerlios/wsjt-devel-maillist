<PRE>Hi James,

Nice to hear from you!

Yes, the problem has to do with multi-threading.

We don't need recursion, in the sense of a routine being 
able to safely call itself.

We *do* need much of the WSJT code (and the underlying 
Fortran runtime) to be re-entrant in the sense of being 
&quot;thread safe&quot;.

The runtime &quot;libgfortran&quot; was upgraded to thread-safe status 
as of gfortran 4.1, in November 2005.  I haven't found a 
definitive statement about g95.  There is nothing intrinsic 
about Fortran that makes it less capable of being 
thread-safe than other languages.

I believe the problem we've been trying to isolate can be 
ascribed to not using mutex lockouts around some critical 
sections of code where different threads may try to access 
the same resource.

In revision 1271 of the WSJT repository (under 
.../branches/wsjt8) I have added a file fthread.c that 
provides Fortran wrappers for basic functions in the Posix 
pthreads library, and a simple Fortran program that tests 
multi-threading with and without mutex lockouts.  I also 
placed a tarfile of this stuff at

<A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/test_threads.tgz">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/test_threads.tgz</A>

If interested, you might want to play with this simple 
program.  I found it very instructive.
