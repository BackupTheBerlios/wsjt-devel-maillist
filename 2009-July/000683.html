<PRE>To: Microwave users of WSJT

Based on results of some fairly extensive tests of the JT4x 
modes on terrestrial 23 cm paths, carried out by members of 
the UK microwave group, I have implemented some improvements 
to the JT4 decoder.

If you have read the description of JT2 and JT4 modes at 
<A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/JT2_JT4.TXT">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/JT2_JT4.TXT</A> , you 
will have seen the following table that shows tone spacings, 
total bandwidths, and threshold S/N limits for each of the 
JT4 submodes:

Mode  Spacing   BW  S/N limit  Possible Applications
         (Hz)    (Hz)   (dB)
----------------------------------------------------
JT4A    4.375   17.5   -23     EME at VHF/UHF
JT4B    8.75    35.0   -22
JT4C   17.5     70.0   -21
JT4D   39.375  157.5   -20     2.3, 3.4 GHz EME
JT4E   78.75   315.0   -19     5.7 GHz EME
JT4F  157.5    630.0   -18     10 GHz EME
JT4G  315.0   1260.0   -17

The seven JT4x submodes are intended to provide a range of 
tone-spacing options so as to accommodate a variety of 
propagation conditions -- in particular, different amounts 
of Doppler spreading on the path.

Experiments by the UK microwave gang have established that 
on 23 cm paths of a few hundred km, submodes JT4A-C will 
seldom decode, even with what appears to be adequate signal 
strength.  JT4D decodes sometimes, and JT4E-G usually 
decode.  I interpret this to mean that the frequency 
spreading on the tested paths is typically several tens of 
Hz, perhaps sometimes approaching 100 Hz.  If the spread 
exceeds the tone spacing, decoding ability will be severely 
degraded.

Of course, to be safe one might always use JT4G, with its 
315 Hz tone spacing; but as the table shows, with the old 
decoder this can cost up to 7 dB in lost sensitivity when 
the path spread is actually much smaller.

The new JT4 decoder obviates this problem by trying each of 
the detection bandwidths 4.375, 8.75, 17.5, 39.375, 78.75, 
157.5, and 315 Hz, in turn, until a good decode is obtained. 
  The effect is that for an unspread signal, JT4G is now 
just as sensitive as JT4A.  Decoding now takes somewhat 
longer, but the impact is small enough that with modern 
computers you probably won't notice it.

I have not yet seen many examples of *.WAV files for 1296 
MHz troposcatter signals, so I am in a sense &quot;flying blind&quot; 
in attempts to improve JT4 for this application.  I suspect 
that the next important area for improvement will be to 
implement AFC in software.  Some user input (and a 
collection of example files) would be most helpful here!

To download a trial version of WSJT with these improvements, 
  use one of the following links:

For Windows:

<A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT704r1268.EXE">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT704r1268.EXE</A>

To install, simply execute the downloaded file.

################################################################
For Ubuntu Linux 9.04 (and probably other recent 
Debian-based Linux distributions):

<A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjt7_r1268.tgz">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/wsjt7_r1268.tgz</A>

To install and run, put the downloaded file in your login 
directory and type the following commands in a 
command-prompt window:

$ tar xzf wsjt7_r1268.tgz
$ cd wsjt
$ python wsjt.py

I look forward to receiving some reports from users!
