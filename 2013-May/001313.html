Hello Joe,

It's been great to see the focus and energy going into the new -X 
releases of your programs by the community but I do have a concern. 
Specifically, they seem to be issues revolving around portability:

    Qt: I use Centos 6 which is very stable but not exactly cutting edge 
either.  I've also noticed that MANY HAMs out there usually run older 
generations of Windows machines (XP, etc) so I think this point is very 
valid.  On the Centos6 side, it ships with Qt 3.3 by default and the 
stock repo offers a upgrade to qt-4.6.  Qt5 is VERY new and requiring 
that will create a lot of difficulty for a lot of Linux users if you 
force this as a requirement.  It's not to say that upgrades aren't 
possible for HAMs running older distros but installing and getting the 
required tool chains can be very intimidating to them.

    DX Labs Commander: Would this be the solution for Windows platforms 
or are you proposing this for all platforms?  As I understand it, DX 
Labs software will not run natively under Linux. I've had good luck with 
W1HKJ's flrig and I've also had pretty decent luck with hamlib as well.

   Qt vs Pulse vs PortAudio:  I personally prefer PortAudio's simplicity 
on Linux but the flexibility of PulseAudio's audio routing functionality 
is hard to deny.  Going the Qt route for audio seems like it would only 
complicate things but I could be wrong here.

Anyway, thanks again to you and your team of developers on the great 
software you've been working on.
