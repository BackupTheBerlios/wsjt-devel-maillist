<PRE>Hi all,

It would be nice if we understood exactly what's happening with WSJT-X's 
audio output under Linux.  It works, but a few details of exactly how it 
works are presently obscure at best.

In particular: Some time ago, Edson (PY2SDR) found that although the 
code in soundout.cpp explicitly sets the number of output channels to 1 
in the statement &quot;outParam.channelCount=1&quot; (line #145 in revision 3318), 
some audio devices act as though they are expecting dual-channel 
(&quot;stereo&quot;) data anyway.  To deal with this we inserted two &quot;#ifdef unix&quot; 
conditionals so that we would send the same audio data to each of the 
two channels.

More recently, John (AC6SL) and I have determined that other audio 
devices behave as we originally thought all should behave -- i.e., they 
act like single-channel (&quot;mono&quot;) devices when told to do so.

I don't yet understand why this is so, or how to fix it properly. 
Perhaps it will be taken care of when/if we move from portAudio to 
QAudio.  In the meantime, as a temporary work-around, in revisions 
3317/3318 I have inserted code that makes all audio output on unix-like 
platforms use two channels.  On my test Linux system, at least, this 
makes all relevant audio devices (and pseudo-devices invoked with an 
&quot;.asoundrc&quot; file) work properly.

Please check to see if this works OK on your Linux system.

	-- Joe, K1JT
