<PRE>Hi Joe,

Regarding the PSK Reporter interface, I think we could try using the code I
have implemented also on Windows. I see no reason why it would not work. I
have not done so because I do not have a windows machine available for
testing at the moment. Could you remove the &quot;#ifdef UNIX&quot; for the new PSK
Reporter calls, include some &quot;#if 0&quot;, and perform some testing? If things
work, we could also remove the dependency on the PSK Reporter DLL.

73,

&gt;<i> Thanks for the comments on my organizational proposal for subsequent

</I>&gt;<i> Following gentle reminders from AC6SL and G4KLA, I've cleaned up all
</I>&gt;<i> remaining compiler warnings produced on my systems (both Windows and
</I>&gt;<i> Linux), and I've made a few other minor tweaks to the code.  I am hereby
</I>&gt;<i> proposing that SVN revision 3320 is a candidate for release as WSJT-X
</I>&gt;<i> Version 1.0, possibly tomorrow?  Please let me know if you foresee any
</I>&gt;<i> problems.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Looking ahead:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with Edson that support for many OS-specific external programs
</I>&gt;<i> could rapidly become problematic.  I see this as a conflict between the
</I>&gt;<i> worthwhile goals of keeping the program &quot;pure&quot; (reasonably free of
</I>&gt;<i> OS-dependent #ifdef's etc.), and having it widely adopted on the most
</I>&gt;<i> popular platforms and with the most popular companion software.  At present
</I>&gt;<i> we are providing some support for JT-Alert, Ham Radio Deluxe (Windows only)
</I>&gt;<i> and PSK Reporter (Windows and Linux, but with separate code).  (Possibly
</I>&gt;<i> Edson's code for PSK Reporter can also be used on Windows; I haven't
</I>&gt;<i> tried.)  I suggested that we should support DxLab Commander at about the
</I>&gt;<i> same level that we do HRD.  This would also be Windows only, and quite
</I>&gt;<i> possibly it should be the last such effort we make.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> It would be good to look further at Edson's suggestion that we could
</I>&gt;<i> develop a generalized inter-program interface -- a file or socket with the
</I>&gt;<i> necessary hooks so that a separate, OS-dependent program could act as a
</I>&gt;<i> link to other software.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I also agree that native support for IQ transceivers like the SoftRock
</I>&gt;<i> would be a good development goal.  My experience doing this with WSPR
</I>&gt;<i> suggests that the number of users might be a modest fraction of the total,
</I>&gt;<i> but the level of user enthusiasm would be high.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> One final thought.  The present usage of JT9 is such that there is little
</I>&gt;<i> reason to restrict the decoding frequency range (and that displayed in the
</I>&gt;<i> waterfall) to 1000 Hz.  When adding other modes -- probably JT65 first --
</I>&gt;<i> my current plan is to increase the maximum displayed bandwidth to more like
</I>&gt;<i> 4 or 5 kHz.
