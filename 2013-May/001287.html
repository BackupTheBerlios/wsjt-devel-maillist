<PRE>Hi all -- and especially users of WSJT-X under Linux,

A few words about recent evolution of the WSJT-X code, and some upcoming 
plans.

Up to now, all of my JT9 operating has been done under Windows.  Over 
the past weekend I installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my main hamshack 
computer, so I could play with WSJT-X under a current distribution of 
Linux.  Getting it to work in my setup involved some necessary changes 
to ptt_unix.c and the way it is called from the GUI.  This effort drew 
my attention to some weaknesses in the way we allow users to specify 
such things as &quot;PTT Port&quot;.

Is it true that everyone using WSJT-X under Linux has selected either 
CAT of VOX for PTT Method?  It seems this must be the case, since we 
have provided no way to select a device such as /dev/ttyS0 for PTT 
control via the DTR or RTS line of a serial port.  Since that's what I 
normally use in my station setup, I implemented it that way, temporarily 
&quot;hard-wiring&quot; the code to use my device /dev/ttyS0.  (This code has not 
been committed to the SVN repository, as yet.)

My present plan is to change the QComboBox now offering a list of PTT 
Port options to a QLineEdit, instead.  Then one can type in a value such 
as &quot;COM1&quot; in Windows, or &quot;/dev/ttyS0&quot; in *nix.

Does this make sense to everyone?

In making these tests I also became aware of a fact that should have 
been obvious -- details of the GUI appearance are not just different on 
Windows and Linux, but different on Linux distributions using different 
window managers.  The default Ubuntu distribution even removes the menu 
bar from the main window, displaying it instead at the top of screen. 
(Yes, I learned how to disable this feature.)

Another change, this time already committed to the SVN repository: for 
the present, at least, I disabled submodes JT9-5, JT9-10, and JT9-30, 
(which are not being used, as far as I know).  The program's memory 
requirements are now smaller by some 150 MB.

Comments and other proposals are welcome, as always.

	-- Joe, K1JT
