<PRE>Hi Dave,

I don't have a Mac in the shack :-) but the the XYL does development on a MacBook Pro with the latest SDK, Qt, etc etc with OS, 10.7. I did some poking around on to see where things were located.

Couple Things:

First, for the the Makfile.linux (make -f Makefile.linux) you need to edit the INCPATH:

INCPATH = &#160;-I'/usr/include/qt4' -I'/usr/include/qt4/QtCore'&#160;


For me, Qwt-qt4 Libs were installed here:

INCPATH = &#160;-I'/lib/qt4-mac/include/qwt -I'/lib/qt4-mac/include/qwt/QtCore'&#160;

You'll need to check on your box where the libs are located and adjust accordingly.

Same thing for wsjtx.pro:

Adjust the qwt/include and LIBS+= statement&#160;according to your system:

unix {
INCLUDEPATH += $$quote(/lib/qt4-mac/include/qwt)
LIBS += ../wsjtx/lib/libjt9.a
LIBS += -lhamlib
LIBS += -lportaudio -lgfortran -lfftw3f -lqwt
}

echo $PATH showed the /libs dir in the path, so you could try excluding the INCLUDEPATH directive. If you know where they are, probably best to include it.

One last thing. When you run make -f Makefile.linux the first time, you need to ensure the install directory wsjt_install actually exists, otherwise, jt9 will be copied to &quot;wsjt_install&quot; as a file, v.s. being placed in the directory of ../wsjt_install. It should be at the root level of the svn co ../wsjtx and ../wsjtx_install

Good Luck,


73's Greg, KI7MT

I made a bit of progress working my way through the Makefile.linux, but am going to call it a night.  WIll pick it back up tomorrow, but would appreciate any guidance anyone may have on overall requirements for building for OS X 10.8.  Will share any developments I get tomorrow.  73 Dave  --
