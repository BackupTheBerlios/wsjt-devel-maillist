<PRE>Hi Joe!

In the past I modified the content of the boxes containing the tty (cat) 
devices directly in the source code to adapt them. I use VOX mode as 
standard.
Yes it makes sense for me to have an editable input line there.
Is it possible to get something similar to an .ini or .xml file the 
program can read and write system specific settings, that we can edit 
offline?

There is another problem with the source for Linux.
Program crashes always when txing cycle is over or when tuning is stopped.
It is similar in wsjtx and wsprx, but I had it never in wspr and wsjt. I 
had this problem at actual releases 64bit of ubuntu 12.04/12.10 and 
debian 7. I tried it with 3 fresh installations to be shure to have 
clean systems. Even changing libriaries didn't change anything.
Unfortuanetly when I wrote here to the list I got no reply to this 
matter. Even not a hint where to start with troubleshooting.

My questions are:
Is this a known problem or only my one?
Is this solved in the meantime by rev. xxxx, because others had similar 
problems?
Is this depending on some special settings not visible at the first view?
Is this the right place to ask this questions?
If there are some problems, should I set some debugging specific flags 
and install additional libraries for that purpose?

Please let me know how to go further on.
73,
Michael oe1msb

&gt;<i> Hi all -- and especially users of WSJT-X under Linux,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> A few words about recent evolution of the WSJT-X code, and some 
</I>&gt;<i> upcoming plans.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Up to now, all of my JT9 operating has been done under Windows. Over 
</I>&gt;<i> the past weekend I installed Ubuntu 12.04 LTS on my main hamshack 
</I>&gt;<i> computer, so I could play with WSJT-X under a current distribution of 
</I>&gt;<i> Linux.  Getting it to work in my setup involved some necessary changes 
</I>&gt;<i> to ptt_unix.c and the way it is called from the GUI.  This effort drew 
</I>&gt;<i> my attention to some weaknesses in the way we allow users to specify 
</I>&gt;<i> such things as &quot;PTT Port&quot;.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Is it true that everyone using WSJT-X under Linux has selected either 
</I>&gt;<i> CAT of VOX for PTT Method?  It seems this must be the case, since we 
</I>&gt;<i> have provided no way to select a device such as /dev/ttyS0 for PTT 
</I>&gt;<i> control via the DTR or RTS line of a serial port.  Since that's what I 
</I>&gt;<i> normally use in my station setup, I implemented it that way, 
</I>&gt;<i> temporarily &quot;hard-wiring&quot; the code to use my device /dev/ttyS0.  (This 
</I>&gt;<i> code has not been committed to the SVN repository, as yet.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My present plan is to change the QComboBox now offering a list of PTT 
</I>&gt;<i> Port options to a QLineEdit, instead.  Then one can type in a value 
</I>&gt;<i> such as &quot;COM1&quot; in Windows, or &quot;/dev/ttyS0&quot; in *nix.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Does this make sense to everyone?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> In making these tests I also became aware of a fact that should have 
</I>&gt;<i> been obvious -- details of the GUI appearance are not just different 
</I>&gt;<i> on Windows and Linux, but different on Linux distributions using 
</I>&gt;<i> different window managers.  The default Ubuntu distribution even 
</I>&gt;<i> removes the menu bar from the main window, displaying it instead at 
</I>&gt;<i> the top of screen. (Yes, I learned how to disable this feature.)
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Another change, this time already committed to the SVN repository: for 
</I>&gt;<i> the present, at least, I disabled submodes JT9-5, JT9-10, and JT9-30, 
</I>&gt;<i> (which are not being used, as far as I know).  The program's memory 
</I>&gt;<i> requirements are now smaller by some 150 MB.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Comments and other proposals are welcome, as always.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>     -- Joe, K1JT
