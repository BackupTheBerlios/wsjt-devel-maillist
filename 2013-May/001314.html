<PRE>Hi David,

1. There's no plan to make Qt5 a requirement for compiling WSJT-X, just 
an option.  In fact it's possible already -- Edson (PY2SDR) and I have 
both made it work, with very few changes to existing code.  The results 
are still backward compatible with Qt4.

2. There's no plan to relax portability requirements.  Rig control 
through hamlib calls was first and foremost in WSJT-X, among possible 
CAT control options.  It will remain so.  Rig control through Ham Radio 
Deluxe was added because many people asked for it; likewise for 
Commander, for which coding is still to be done.  HRD and Commander are 
seen as options, not requirements.

3. I haven't messed with Pulse for audio I/O, but surely it is NOT 
platform-portable, right?  (Windows, OS X ??? ) Qt Audio runs on all 
Qt-capable platforms.

</I>&gt;<i> possible for HAMs running older distros but installing and getting the
</I>&gt;<i> required tool chains can be very intimidating to them.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> DX Labs Commander: Would this be the solution for Windows platforms or
</I>&gt;<i> are you proposing this for all platforms? As I understand it, DX Labs
</I>&gt;<i> software will not run natively under Linux. I've had good luck with
</I>&gt;<i> W1HKJ's flrig and I've also had pretty decent luck with hamlib as well.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Qt vs Pulse vs PortAudio: I personally prefer PortAudio's simplicity on
</I>&gt;<i> Linux but the flexibility of PulseAudio's audio routing functionality is
</I>&gt;<i> hard to deny. Going the Qt route for audio seems like it would only
</I>&gt;<i> complicate things but I could be wrong here.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway, thanks again to you and your team of developers on the great
</I>&gt;<i> software you've been working on.
