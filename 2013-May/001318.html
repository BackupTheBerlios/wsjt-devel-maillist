<PRE>Hello Joe, et al,

On Tue, May 28, 2013 at 11:15 AM, Joe Taylor &lt;<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/wsjt-devel">joe at princeton.edu</A>&gt; wrote:

&gt;<i> Dear colleagues,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I suggest that we are essentially ready to make a release of WSJT-X
</I>&gt;<i> Version 1.0.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Here's an organizational proposal for our subsequent development efforts:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> 1. We should release Version 1.0 very soon -- it will be something close
</I>&gt;<i> to revision 3316.  We would tag this as &quot;WSJT-X-Revision-1.0&quot; and copy it
</I>&gt;<i> to the SVN &quot;tags&quot; area for archiving purposes.  We should make a tar file
</I>&gt;<i> of the complete V1.0 code and post it on the Berlios site.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Ok!


&gt;<i> 2. The present code branch -- the one we have been using for WSJT-X
</I>&gt;<i> development -- would henceforth be reserved for bug fixes (leading to
</I>&gt;<i> versions 1.0.1, 1.0.2, etc...) and possibly some relatively minor feature
</I>&gt;<i> additions (versions 1.1.0, 1.2.0, whatever).
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Sure. This makes a lot of sense. This way we can have a stable release and
a development branch. We can incentive users that are not willing to use
experimental code to stay with the stable release.


&gt;<i> 3. A number of other development ideas have been discussed:
</I>&gt;<i>     - Moving from Qt4 to Qt5, and eliminating dependence on Qwt
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ok.


&gt;<i>     - Adding rig control through DxLab Commander
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ok. I have a small concern with the inflow of requests for adding support
for OS-specific external programs. My rationale is that it is VERY
difficult to satisfy all the requests and we could find ourselves
distracted with fixing issues with the interfaces and dealing with a number
of issues related to different setups. A suggestion I have is for  WSJT-X
to provide a communication mechanism (could be a file or a socket) that
some program could listen to and then communicate with other programs. With
this approach, the WSJT-X code base could be kept clean (without the
variuos #ifdefs for OS-specifi code). It would also allow and foster
interest for other programmers to participate in developing the interfaces.
Thus preserving the modularity of the system.


&gt;<i>     - Migrating from PortAudio to Qt's built-in QAudio handlers
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
Ok. I think this will be a positive step. Although I haven't yet
effectivelly used QAudio on Qt5, from what I have been reading, some of the
earlier issues with audio (mainly related to threads) have been remediated
or resolved. Removing the dependency on Portaudio is also positive since it
makes it easier to compile WSJT-X from sources on different systems. Thus
potentially increasing the user base on the various flavors of Linux
systems.


&gt;<i>     - Adding other WSJT modes: JT65, FSK441, ISCAT, JT4 ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
This will be excellent. I have a few ideas about how to deal with the
particularities for the user interface for each of the modes.


&gt;<i> I suggest that these developments would best be pursued in new, separate
</I>&gt;<i> branches of our SVN tree.  When any one of them matures to the point where
</I>&gt;<i> it would clearly provide desirable new capability for WSJT-X, code from
</I>&gt;<i> that branch can be merged back into the main development branch.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Agreed. This will also give us more freedom to experiment with new code.


&gt;<i> Does this plan make sense to everyone?  Other suggestions?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>One item I would like to suggest is the native support for IQ transceivers
like the SoftRock. I think that the JT modes are a perfect match for QRP
equipment like the SoftRock and this could attract more technical
experimenters.
