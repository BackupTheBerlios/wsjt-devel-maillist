<PRE>Thanks for the comments on my organizational proposal for subsequent 
development efforts.  We seem to be in good agreement.

Following gentle reminders from AC6SL and G4KLA, I've cleaned up all 
remaining compiler warnings produced on my systems (both Windows and 
Linux), and I've made a few other minor tweaks to the code.  I am hereby 
proposing that SVN revision 3320 is a candidate for release as WSJT-X 
Version 1.0, possibly tomorrow?  Please let me know if you foresee any 
problems.

Looking ahead:

I agree with Edson that support for many OS-specific external programs 
could rapidly become problematic.  I see this as a conflict between the 
worthwhile goals of keeping the program &quot;pure&quot; (reasonably free of 
OS-dependent #ifdef's etc.), and having it widely adopted on the most 
popular platforms and with the most popular companion software.  At 
present we are providing some support for JT-Alert, Ham Radio Deluxe 
(Windows only) and PSK Reporter (Windows and Linux, but with separate 
code).  (Possibly Edson's code for PSK Reporter can also be used on 
Windows; I haven't tried.)  I suggested that we should support DxLab 
Commander at about the same level that we do HRD.  This would also be 
Windows only, and quite possibly it should be the last such effort we 
make.

It would be good to look further at Edson's suggestion that we could 
develop a generalized inter-program interface -- a file or socket with 
the necessary hooks so that a separate, OS-dependent program could act 
as a link to other software.

I also agree that native support for IQ transceivers like the SoftRock 
would be a good development goal.  My experience doing this with WSPR 
suggests that the number of users might be a modest fraction of the 
total, but the level of user enthusiasm would be high.

One final thought.  The present usage of JT9 is such that there is 
little reason to restrict the decoding frequency range (and that 
displayed in the waterfall) to 1000 Hz.  When adding other modes -- 
probably JT65 first -- my current plan is to increase the maximum 
displayed bandwidth to more like 4 or 5 kHz.

	-- Joe, K1JT
