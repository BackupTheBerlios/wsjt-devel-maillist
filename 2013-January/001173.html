<PRE>Hi Joe,

Maybe I overlooked a previous discussion about this topic. If so please
apologize...

I have notices that there is a difference in message 1 and 2  between MAP65
(2.4.1 r2587) and WSJT (at least 9.3 r2585 and 4.9.8)
in generating MSG1, if a non-standard call sign is put in as DX call.

I noticed this with OE2013X yesterday, and only if the calling station has a
callsign with 6 characters: I actually saw it with OE2013X UA3PT (missing W
at the end).

I played a bit around this morning, with my own call sign, and came to the
following

in WSJT message would be 
OE2013X OE3FVU JN78

in MAP65 message would be
OE2013X OE3FV


I did some other tests: manual input in DX Call and than hitting GenStdMsgs:

PJ2/PE1LWT as DX Call produced  as Message 1:  PJ2/PE1LWT OE
OE2XXXXX produced OE2XXXXX OE3FVU JN76 (which is corrcet - of course)
OE2444X produced also an error: OE2444X OE3FV

Similar behavious in msg 2 producing OE2444X OE3FV OOO

Manually altering the text in MSG 1 and and even 5 and 6 produced the same
results as soon as I moved away the cursor. 

Perhaps you find some time to look into it ?

Thanks in advance !

Best 73

Franz (OE3FVU / PE0WGA)
