<PRE>Greetings wsjt developers.

I'm interested in taking a look at the wsjt programs and perhaps providing some additional development capability to these projects.   My first stab obviously is to take a bit of time to just build and &quot;play&quot; with the programs, map65 is of particular interest for me.

A bit about me, I've never worked on an open source project and have very little experience with modern linux.  On the other hand, I'm formally (or is that classically) trained as a computer scientist and have over 20 years of hands on development experience in the Windows PC world as well as at the embedded systems level, particularly with Analog Devices DSP's, ARM Cortex M-3's, and some other micro-micro's such as the msp430 and of course the 80x51 families.

I'm sure I will ask some dumb and fundamental questions, but if you can put up with me for a bit to come up to speed, I would love to help out.

Regards,
Paul Decker
