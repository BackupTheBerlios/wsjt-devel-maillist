I have enjoyed coding with both Python and Qt.  GUIs produced with Qt 
arguably &quot;look better&quot; and are more platform independent than those 
built with Python, at least with the Tcl/Tk toolkit under Python.

For me, though, the main reasons for a change included the following:

1. The programs had grown over time, with many add-on features; they 
were becoming unwieldy, difficult to maintain, and much in need of a 
complete redesign.  This seemed a good opportunity for me to learn some 
new programming skills, and I decided to learn Qt and C++.

I soon learned that

2. Qt appears to have a richer and better documented set of classes.

3. Better packaging of the finished program was possible with Qt, in a 
platform-independent way.
