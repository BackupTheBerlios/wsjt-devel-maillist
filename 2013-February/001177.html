Hi Paul,

Perhaps it's time for a general update on the state of development work
on WSJT, MAP65, and WSPR.

I started this effort in 2001, and I made it open-source in 2005.  All
three program suites have had their user interfaces written in Python,
using the Tcl/Tk toolkit.  The number-crunching DSP code is written
mostly in Fortran, with a bit of C thrown in.  The code could be
compiled for Windows, Linux, OS-X, Free BSD, and other Unix-like
operating systems, using free compilers and related tools.  Packaged
click-to-install installation files were always provided for Windows,
and sometimes also for Debian-based Linux distributions.  Some basic
information on compiling the programs is provided on the WSJT web site
at <A HREF="http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/devel.html">http://www.physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/devel.html</A> .  It is not
always fully up-to-date.

The project continues to be fully open-source, and uses free compiler
tools and libraries.  Most of the code is my own; several contributors,
most notably VA3DB and G4KLA, have worked hard on portability issues,
making sure that the code compiles and runs well under Free BSD and OS-X.

Recent development work has been mostly my own, once more.  The program
GUIs are being re-written in C++, using the Qt Framework instead of
Python.  This migration is complete with MAP65; experimental versions of
WSJT and WSPR (called WSJT-X and WSPR-X) are now operational and
available, although they do not yet have all the features of the older
Python-based code.

To compile the new Qt-based programs you need to have installed the free
QT SDK and either g95 or gfortran.  (I tend to use g95 on Windows and
gfortran on Linux, but this is not required.).  In Windows I use the
MinGW system tools.  You need the FFTW3, Qwt, and Portaudio  libraries.
  With all these tools in place, you can compile library libm65.a and
the decoder m65 with the commands

$ cd libm65
$ make                     (in Linux, &quot;make -f Makefile.linux&quot;)

Then open map65.pro in QtCreator and compile map65 from there.
You might need to readjust some paths in the makefiles or the Qt project
file map65.pro to suit your system.  Once you are properly set up,
compiling MAP65 requires only a few typed commands or mouse-clicks.
Installing and gaining familiarity with the necessary tools may take
much longer.

Thanks for your interest!  Let us know how you progress, and if/when you
have ideas or code to contribute.
