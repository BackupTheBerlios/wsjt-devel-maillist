<PRE>Hi Pierre,

&gt;<i> With the help of John/G4KLA, I managed to install WSPR on my Ubuntu
</I>&gt;<i> 9.04.  Thanks to all.
</I>
Happy to hear of your success!

I assume you are aware that many changes have been made to WSPR 
recently, working toward the release of WSPR 2.0.  At any particular 
time it should not be assumed that checking out the head of the 
repository will give you code without bugs, or even code that will 
compile into a working program.

&gt;<i> I know that Leif is working on a Linrad version with portaudio which
</I>&gt;<i> will allow us to use Jack as output.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It would be nice to feed WSPR with the Jack output from Linrad.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Are there any plans to add Jack-input for WSPR ?
</I>
It had been a long time since I looked into Jack, and I do not remember 
many of the details.  WSJT, MAP65, MAP65-IQ, and WSPR all use PortAudio 
and the operating system's standard interfaces to supported sound 
systems.  This is true for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and OS-X, and it is 
true for &quot;pseudo devices&quot; like Virtual Audio Cable (VAC) under windows. 
I assume that in Linux Jack will appear as one or more audio &quot;devices&quot; 
that can be opened for input or output, through PortAudio.  If this is 
correct, I do not think anything more needs to be done to use WSPR with 
Jack.  Maybe I am wrong, though ?
