<PRE>Hi Joe,

I have been tracking changing versions and so far I have no problems  
compiling and executing.  However, I am sure I am only using the  
system in its most basic mode and have not been able to test all the  
latest additions.    New, improved, messages are useful, e.g. when  
upload spots fails because of internet interruptions; selection of  
transmit frequency is good; tune is great; ..

Suggestions:
a)   WSPR.INI should contain defaults.   My version complains (for  
instance):
WSPR Version 2.0_r1660 , by K1JT
Run date:   Wed Nov 11 20:28:15 2009 UTC
Error reading WSPR.INI, while processing
key= Handshake    value= None
Continuing with defaults.

when the line following the reported error line is missing  
something.   In this case, the line after &quot;Handshake None&quot; is  &quot;Rig&quot;  
with no default.   Editing WSPR.INI to insert &quot;Rig 123&quot;  will fix  
it.   Similarly, earlier versions failed with key=dBm when the  
culprit was not, in fact, the dBm line but the next one &quot;PttPort&quot;  
which did not have None as the argument.    Is this just my version  
of python that is objecting?    I suggest play safe and ensure that  
all variables that require a second argument should have some default  
set.

b)  I notice that:
-rw-r--r--   1 jmn  jmn   3587 Nov  5 14:09 WSPR_Announcement.TXT
-rw-r--r--   1 jmn  jmn  11867 Nov  5 14:09 WSPR_Instructions.TXT
-rw-r--r--   1 jmn  jmn   4576 Nov  5 14:09 WSPR_Quick_Start.TXT

remain unchanged from wspr-v1.0-r914, for instance (March 2008).     
If the package is about to go public, would it be useful to update  
these?

c)   wspr2.F90 has a warning which might be important:   nrxnormal  
may be used uninitialized (line 61)

d)  Diane managed to figure out how to generate the fftw library so  
that it uses conventional Fortran entry point names.   Can this be  
done so that four2a.f doesn't have to be a unique exception in the  
way it calls routines?   That is, with a trailing underscore?

e)  I am working on the problem of creating a package for Mac OSX -  
but this will take time as other thing are on my plate at the  
moment.  However, given minimal infrastructure, downloading source  
from the repository and compiling is straightfoward.   I could modify  
my WSJT HowTo for WSPR  if you wish to include HowTo's in the WSPR  
branch for different OS's.
