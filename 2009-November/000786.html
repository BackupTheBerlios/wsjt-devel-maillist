<PRE>Hello Pierre and Joe,

&gt;<i> This sounds plausible to me.  WSPR does use blocking I/O for

</I>&gt;<i> callback mode.  There is no particularly good reason for 
</I>&gt;<i> this distinction.  It came about when I was first writing 
</I>&gt;<i> WSPR; I wanted to try the &quot;other&quot; PortAudio method, to see 
</I>&gt;<i> what advantages/disadvantages there might be.
</I>
PortAudio is supposed to work in both callback and blocking modes even
though JACK itself uses callbacks -- similar to how OSS can be used in
callback mode.

&gt;<i> If there turns out to be a good reason to convert WSPR to 
</I>&gt;<i> using the callback method, this could certainly be done.
</I>
I remember blocking mode not working as reliably as callback mode, and
for some reason some ALSA devices could not be opened with
frames-per-buffer = 0 (unspecified) -- which did work in callback mode.
That that was many months ago and may have be fixed now.  There is a
more recent trouble report on the PortAudio mailing list:

  <A HREF="http://music.columbia.edu/pipermail/portaudio/2009-August/009337.html">http://music.columbia.edu/pipermail/portaudio/2009-August/009337.html</A>

This is probably not (yet) a good enough reason to convert WSPR to
callbacks; maybe something to remember if you start getting
audio-related bug reports...

&gt;<i> Do take note of the fact that starting with r1628, WSPR is 
</I>&gt;<i> using 48 kHz sampling instead of 12 kHz.
</I>
&gt;<i> Most of the WSPR code assumes a 12 kHz sample rate. I had 
</I>&gt;<i> thought that this would be a good match to nearly all of 
</I>&gt;<i> today's sound cards, which could use their 48 kHz native 
</I>&gt;<i> sample rate and do an easy filter/decimation stage to 
</I>&gt;<i> produce the 12 kHz samples requested by WSPR.  I was 
</I>&gt;<i> astonished to learn from G3ZOD that when WSPR is started on 
</I>&gt;<i> a machine with a Delta44 sound card, Windows (or the Delta44 
</I>&gt;<i> driver?) sets its hardware sample rate to 44100 Hz (not 
</I>&gt;<i> 48000 Hz!) and then does a relative poor sample-rate 
</I>&gt;<i> conversion to produce the 12000 Hz samples.  Aarrgghh!
</I>
We have seen this as well with fldigi: Windows/MME uses 44100 for its
internal mixing.  I have read, but not verified, that DirectSound does
not do that if there is only one application accessing the sound card
(and people say the Linux audio APIs are convoluted!).

Because of this mess, we link fldigi/win32 binaries with a version of
PortAudio that supports both WMME and (by default) DirectSound -- so at
least there's a chance of avoiding the bad resampling :) DirectSound is
easy to enable in PortAudio using a modified wine header (no need for
enormous SDK downloads from MS).  There is some information in this
message:

  <A HREF="http://music.columbia.edu/pipermail/portaudio/2009-October/009546.html">http://music.columbia.edu/pipermail/portaudio/2009-October/009546.html</A>

And the modified dsound.h header is here:

  <A HREF="http://enotty.net/tmp/pa/">http://enotty.net/tmp/pa/</A>

&gt;<i> So maybe it will be more reliable to have WSPR (and 
</I>&gt;<i> eventually WSJT?) sample at 48 kHz, and do any rate 
</I>&gt;<i> conversions myself.
</I>
This is what we try to do in fldigi: open the audio device at its native
sample rate and resample with libsamplerate.

Unfortunately it seems that both WMME and DSound will lie about the
native sample rate.  I have seen audio devices that can only capture at
48 and 96 KHz (when opened via a hw:x,y ALSA device), but miraculously
support all standard rates on Windows, with the &quot;native&quot; one being 44100
KHz.  Thanks so much MS! :)

So it might be best to just assume 48K and resample.
