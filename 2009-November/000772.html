<PRE>Hi John and all,

&gt;<i> I am looking at making a WSJT package that can be downloaded to a  
</I>&gt;<i> Mac.    There isn't a pyinstaller for a Mac so the best would be to  
</I>&gt;<i> encapsulate parts of WsjtMod/* together with some relevant  
</I>&gt;<i> libraries.   The question is the definition of &quot;some&quot;.
</I>
You're approaching this the same way I did.  As far as I 
know this makes sense, but I am anything but experienced at 
making software packages on *nix.

The .deb packages I made for wsjt and wspr assume that these
packages are already installed:

    python-numpy
    python-tk
    python-imaging-tk
    libsamplerate0

I'm sure it's possible to have this dependence built into 
the package, so that these things will be installed 
automatically, if necessary.  I had not figured out how to 
do this step, so I left it up to the user.

&gt;<i> In the DEB package, what basic infrastructure is assumed to be in  
</I>&gt;<i> place on the host system?   Fortran and POSIX thread libraries?    
</I>&gt;<i> Complete python/numpy/tk infrastructure?   Anything else?    If this  
</I>&gt;<i> is the full list, then I could include appropriate advice to Mac  
</I>&gt;<i> users that at least these should be present and the rest will be  
</I>&gt;<i> provided as part of the package.
</I>
Yes, that's exactly what I did.

&gt;<i> I assume that specific libraries (portaudio, samplerate, fftw) will  
</I>&gt;<i> be provided as part of the package and, on a Mac, will be downloaded  
</I>&gt;<i> to the appropriate directory.
</I>
There are probably more polished ways of doing this, but it 
should work.

I have now retrieved the .deb package made for WSJT 5.9.7 
r383 by VK3SB.  Maybe I can build on what Hamish did way 
back then, and end up with a better package than my simple one.

Finally: thanks for the EME QSO on 2m, a couple of evenings 
ago!  As far as I can recall, it's a milestone: the first 
EME QSO using WSJT tools, between active WSJT development 
group members.  :-)

	-- Joe, K1JT
