<PRE>I had previously reported that r1631 executes correctly.    This was  
premature.   The test (on Mac OSX) was mainly to check that there  
were no link errors.

I am having trouble with the versions after r1627, namely when the  
sampling rate was increased to 48000.   Here's what I see:

WSPR Version 2.0_r1631 , by  
K1JT                                     // this at the end of the  
&quot;tune&quot; cycle
Run date:   Fri Nov  6 11:32:17 2009 UTC
An error occured while using the portaudio stream
Error number: -9980
Error message: Output underflowed
  Error in soundout          -1

WSPR Version 2.0_r1631 , by K1JT                                   //  
this at the end of a receive cycle.   at approx 1min 56 secs
Run date:   Fri Nov  6 11:33:32 2009 UTC
An error occured while using the portaudio stream
Error number: -9981
Error message: Input overflowed
  Error in soundin          -1

I am using a SignaLink USB interface with specification:
&quot;Sampling size/rate:  16 bit.  All standard rates are supported up to  
48Khz&quot;

padevsub.c checks sample rate with Pa_IsFormatSupported and it is  
satisfied.   It writes audio_caps as follows:
  0    2    2       0       0  Built-in Audio
  1    0    2       1       0  USB Audio CODEC       no errors from  
Pa_IsFormatSupported
  2    2    0       0       1  USB Audio CODEC       no  
errors            ditto

USB Probe gives this information:
         Descriptor Version Number:   0x0110
         Device Class:   0   (Composite)
         Device Subclass:   0
         Device Protocol:   0
         Device MaxPacketSize:   8
         Device VendorID/ProductID:   0x08BB/0x2904   (Texas  
Instruments Japan)
         Device Version Number:   0x0100
         Number of Configurations:   1
         Manufacturer String:   1 &quot;Burr-Brown from TI              &quot;
         Product String:   2 &quot;USB Audio CODEC &quot;
         Serial Number String:   0 (none)

It seems that the device should be recognised correctly by wspr so I  
conclude (for the moment) that there is some curious behaviour on my  
Mac from portaudio but cannot figure out what it is.

If I arbitrarily reduce the number of frames (3rd argument to  
Pa_ReadStream) by 50%, then the error (input overflow) still occurs,  
this time after 1 minute.    How can it have overflowed?

Question:   Joe - any idea where I should look next?
