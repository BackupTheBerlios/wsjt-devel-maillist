</I>
This sounds plausible to me.  WSPR does use blocking I/O for 
its calls to PortAudio; WSJT, MAP65, and MPA65-IQ use 
callback mode.  There is no particularly good reason for 
this distinction.  It came about when I was first writing 
WSPR; I wanted to try the &quot;other&quot; PortAudio method, to see 
what advantages/disadvantages there might be.

If there turns out to be a good reason to convert WSPR to 
using the callback method, this could certainly be done.

Do take note of the fact that starting with r1628, WSPR is 
using 48 kHz sampling instead of 12 kHz.

Most of the WSPR code assumes a 12 kHz sample rate. I had 
thought that this would be a good match to nearly all of 
today's sound cards, which could use their 48 kHz native 
sample rate and do an easy filter/decimation stage to 
produce the 12 kHz samples requested by WSPR.  I was 
astonished to learn from G3ZOD that when WSPR is started on 
a machine with a Delta44 sound card, Windows (or the Delta44 
driver?) sets its hardware sample rate to 44100 Hz (not 
48000 Hz!) and then does a relative poor sample-rate 
conversion to produce the 12000 Hz samples.  Aarrgghh!

So maybe it will be more reliable to have WSPR (and 
eventually WSJT?) sample at 48 kHz, and do any rate 
conversions myself.

&gt;<i> I will drop this question on the portaudio mailinglist to get it
</I>&gt;<i> confirmed, unless someone else from this list can do it.
</I>
Good idea.  I will look forward to hearing what you learn.
