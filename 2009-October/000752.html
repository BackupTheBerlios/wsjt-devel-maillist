<PRE>Hi John,

Many thanks for your message!

I try to make sure that revisions of WSPR, WSJT, MAP65, and 
MAP65-IQ will compile on three different systems.  These are 
currently

1. Win/XP with Compag Visual Fortran and VC6
2. Win/XP with MinGW and g95
3. Ubuntu 9.04 linux and either gfortran or g95

Windows installation files intended &quot;for the masses&quot; have 
been done with system 1, but I'm thinking of changing to 
system 2.  Both CVF and VC6 are long in the tooth, and are 
not free; moreover, I cannot seem to make system 1 work with 
the FFTW &quot;wisdom&quot; facility, which is desitable for MAP65.

Since I haven't learned how to use the autoconf, etc., 
tools, I've handled the need for different syntax in 
Makefiles by maintaining files names Makefile.CVF and 
Makefile.MinGW, in addition to Makefile.in.  Obviously, we 
could also have a Makefile.Mac, or put code into 
configure.ac that would allow '--enable-macintosh' to do 
what you need for the Makefile.

As for the post-fixed underscores (or lack thereof) in 
four2a.f -- I haven't spent the time to find the precise 
reason that some of my configurations have required them and 
others do not.

Yes, the code in four2a.f has evolved a bit and the versions 
in different branches may not be identical, presently.  But 
unless I've made a mistake, I think they all use the 
post-fix underscore now.  Thant's what my present 
combinations of compilers and Makefiles seem to be happy with.

As always, I would be delighted to have someone make it more 
logical, or tell me how to do so!

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
