<PRE>Here's another update on the status of experimental modes 
JT2 and JT4.

A number of people have downloaded the packaged Windows 
version r550 at

<A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT597r550.EXE">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT597r550.EXE</A>

Several people have compiled this version from the source 
code for *nix, as well.  I have received some reports of 
on-the-air use, and the results are generally consistent 
with my own observations:

1. JT2 works, but the decoding performance of r550 is 
disappointing in this mode.

2. JT4 works well on 144 MHz EME, but its S/N performance is 
0.5 to 1 dB worse than JT65B.

JT2 and JT4A have one significant advantage over JT65B: 
their total occupied bandwidths are 8.75 and 17.5 Hz, 
respectively, compared with 355 Hz fot JT65B.  The narrow 
bandwidths could greatly facilitate random EME operation, 
since 50 or more of the narrow signals could be scattered at 
random within an SSB receiver's passband with at most only a 
few collisions.

##############################################################

I am not willing to give up yet on the PSK-encoded data 
scheme in JT2.  I have now made significant improvements to 
the JT2 decoder.  It is still not optimum; I know of several 
things that must be improved, especially for signals that 
drift.  This will be done ... but I will probably not get to 
it for at least two weeks.

I have also made improvememts to the JT4 decoder, especially 
for the trial submodes JT4B - JT4G.

A packaged WSJT r555 for Windows has been placed at

<A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT597r555.EXE">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSJT597r555.EXE</A>

and of course the new source code is in the respository.

YOu will recall that for testing purposes I defined 7 
sub-modes of JT4, namely JT4A through JT4G.  The transmitted 
signals differ only in the spacing of tones and total 
occupied bandwidth, as shown in the following table:

JT4   Spacing   BW  S/N limit
        (Hz)    (Hz)   (dB)
------------------------------
  A     4.375   17.5   -23
  B     8.75    35.0   -22
  C    17.5     70.0   -21
  D    39.375  157.5   -20
  E    78.75   315.0   -19
  F   157.5    630.0   -18
  G   315.0   1260.0   -17

The approximate S/N limits in the table refer to conditions 
in which frequency spreading is less than the tone 
separation.  The wide spacings are intended for use where 
the path spreading exceeds the narrower tone spacings.  The 
operational goal is for the four transmitted tones to be 
clearly separated on the waterfall and on the &quot;red curve&quot;.

You will notice that the red curve has 3 &quot;side lobes&quot; of
diminishing amplitude on either side of the main peak.  This 
is normal, and a natural result of the embedded sync 
mechanism used in JT4.

Neither the JT2 nor the JT4 decoder is optimized at present. 
  For best performance they will need AFC and other features 
such as message averaging, Deep Search, etc., as well as 
fine-tuning of some decoding parameters.  They work pretty 
well, however, and on-the-air tests are needed in order to 
make progress.  Both JT2 and JT4A have been used to make EME 
QSOs on 2m, even with the r550 decoder.

If you make on-the-air tests of these experimental modes, 
please send me your results or report them on this 
reflector.  Likewise if you have observations based on 
&quot;bench testing&quot;, or on your examination of the source code.
