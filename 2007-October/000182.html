<PRE>To:      Users of WSJT
From:    Joe Taylor, K1JT
Subject: Experimental Modes JT2 and JT4
Date:    October 11, 2007

Thanks to all who have tested the experimental modes JT2 and 
JT4 in WSJT 5.9.8 r558 ... and special thanks if you 
reported your observations to me or on one of the relevant 
reflectors, or sent me representative wave files.  I can 
report that over the past few days QSOs have now been made 
with both JT2 and JT4 on amateur bands and propagation modes 
ranging from trans-Atlantic nighttime DX on 1.8 MHz to 144 
MHz EME.  In addition, JT4 has been used to send and receive 
messages on 10 GHz EME.

If you have not sent comments or a report, it's not too 
late!  Please note that some of the most useful wave files 
are those containing received signals that you think 
&quot;should&quot; have decoded, but did not.  I am interested in 
reports of all types of on-the-air tests, from HF to microwaves.

As described in the announcement posted several days ago at 
<A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/JT2_JT4.TXT">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/JT2_JT4.TXT</A> , the 
new modes are basically functional but do not yet have 
certain amenities that JT65 users are accustomed to.  The 
new modes show considerable promise, but for a number of 
reasons they are not yet ready for general use:

1. Decoding performance is overly dependent on the average 
audio level at the sound card input, and perhaps other factors.

2. Software AFC should be included, to correct small 
frequency drifts.

3. Options for message averaging and matched filtering 
should be included in the decoders.

These improvements should not be very difficult to make, but 
my own schedule is such that they will probably take at 
least some weeks to complete.


I have not heard much from others about the appearance of 
JT2 and JT4 signals on the SpecJT waterfall, or the 
perceived operational importance of the narrow bandwidths of 
these modes compared to JT65.  Some relevant facts are these:

1. JT65B, the dominant mode for 144 MHz EME, has bandwidth 
B=355 Hz.  JT65A, mostly used on HF and 50 MHz, had B=177 
Hz.  These modes have a narrow &quot;sync tone&quot; only 2.7 Hz wide, 
which is easy to recognize on a waterfall display.

2. JT2 has bandwidth B=8.75 Hz and JT4A B=17.5 Hz.  In these 
modes sync information is embedded in the data stream. 
Waterfall traces of JT2 and JT4 signals are therefore much 
narrower than the full extent of JT65 signals, but appear 
&quot;fuzzy&quot; compared to the JT65 sync tone.

3. Many JT2 or JT4A signals can fit into the bandpass of a 
standard SSB transceiver without interfering.  This means 
that random digital EME operation could become easy if, for 
example, JT2 activity were concentrated in a relatively 
small (5 or 10 kHz?) portion of each band.  It would then be 
possible for WSJT to acquire many of the advantages of the 
MAP65 software, which at present are available only to those 
with wide-band receiving systems like Linrad.

4. The probability for collisions between JT65 signals or 
between a JT65 signal and a birdie is much larger than that 
for the much narrower JT2 or JT4A signals.  On the other 
hand, the JT65 decoder is relatively mature and has been 
made remarkably immune to QRM.  The performance of JT2 and 
JT4 in comparable situations is not yet known.

Community input on these matters is needed!  Assuming that 
the present deficiencies of JT2/JT4 can be corrected, so 
that S/N performance is essentially equal to that of JT65, 
do you consider the narrow bandwidth of JT2/JT4 to be a 
significant advantage?  Or should we forget about JT2/JT4 
(at least on bands where JT65 is now widely used), and stick 
with JT65?  Please share your views on these and any other 
questions you think relevant.

PS: I will be traveling for much of the next week, so any 
responses will likely be delayed.
